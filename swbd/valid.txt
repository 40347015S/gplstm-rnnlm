 darn  
 well currently i li- actual live in virginia and virginia does have the death penalty but  
 obviously it would have to be i- an- we- what we have to decide on is whether is whether it is right for a certain crimes or not  
  
 such as like the murdering of a cop or  
 alo- along those lines fir-  
 rehabilitation of yeah  
 this is true  
 right  
 there is there is there is no chance of rehabilitation beside the- fact of wh- what rehabilitation actually costs and the m- cost of keeping someone in jail  
 on a life sentence as opposed to th- death penalty  
 that is another thing to look at wha- what the taxpayers have to pay and the difference in costs  
  
 right  
 right and we are basically paying for him to lo- stay alive  
 and if you polled the general public who would want to keep him alive is a another question  
 no no it does not work on every issue  
 a time frame how is that  
 appealing it right  
 i see  
 i wanna continue along the lines of fair and speedy trial  
 um-hum  
 so i guess that would fall into the category of premeditated murder what o- what other crimes  
 no white collar crime does not exactly fall into it  
 right  
 and rape but rape cases are so hard to prove a- as it is  
 uh-huh  
 and and how can y- how can you put someone\'s life up against that  
 um-hum  
 what about methods of of the death penalty  
 which a- which are i guess  
 okay yeah that is what they are doing here  
 the preferred method yeah  
 i do not know i think there there may have be one may still be one or two states that do  
  
 the gas chamber is i know is out  
 gas is out  
 firing squad th- a bit ar- exactly yeah that -at that is a bit archaic  
  
 i mean regardless it should be quick and  
 i ha- yeah i hate to say painless because but you know  
 right suffering  
 all right jeff well what do you think of capital punishment  
 um-hum um-hum  
 well i- i think there are certain crimes that that it is it is definitely called for  
 well yes such a- yes alo- along definitely along those lines i- i do not have any  
 how do i want to say this i am not interested in rehabil- rein reha- rein- rein- rehabilitating of certain of criminals that do certain things and  
 you know things like like jeffrey dahlmer you know killing people and mutilating them and and obviously doing  
 very weird things i- i do not have any i do not have any problem giving him the capital punishment punishment at all  
 there is i think you you know in a society you have to draw a line somewhere and say hey if you cross this line that is it  
 exactly exactly  
 sure sure it costs every one of us to to support that person  
 you know shoot that is i- you may be locked up but it is it is still room and board  
 exactly exactly  
 yeah i agree now you know you cannot go an eye for an eye i- i guess on every on every aspect  
 you know and in in y- it has to be i think you have to define that fairly carefully  
 so that you know you would it is not an a- an a- an abused thing but the one thing that  
 that it ought to be is you ought to know exactly what is going to happen and there ought to be a time frame for it to happen  
 well in other words you put somebody on on death row and and you can go on for ten or fifteen years appealing everything you know there ou- there ought to be you know i am not saying it ought to be like you know two weeks and then you are gone but  
 there ought to be some sort of vehicle to make it expeditious  
 yeah exactly exactly fair and speedy all the way down the line i guess  
 it is you know it is it is a tough thing to decide but  
 goodness it is i had not really thought much much past that  
 you know something like bank fraud or something like that certainly does not deserve the  
 no no  
 you know when you get into things like child molestation and and rape now that is  
 the- the- you know i am not sure about that  
 you know aggravated rape i with di- i would think would have to you would have to consider that as in the in the death penalty range  
 yes exactly exactly  
 i mean that is be almost one one person\'s word against another  
 you you- you are you are right about that but when you get down to  
  
 i guess what is the in texas called aggravated rape which is basically brutal beating type type attack that is  
 i do not know there- there is certain cert- certain aspects of that that  
 i would have to think would would fall under that  
 well in texas we have lethal injection  
 and i think that is if you want to call it the preferred method i do not think it i do not anybody does elec- electrocution anymore do they  
 yeah yeah  
 well when when gary gilmore got was executed in nevada  
 gosh it is pro- probably about eight eight- or ten years ago now or even- probably even fifteen he was in- you know f- put in front of a in- put in front of a firing squad  
 which seems a little a little archaic  
 qui- yeah it should be quick and painless and i-  
 well as opposed to ju- you know chopping off fingers and watching somebody bleed to death s- i mean yes suffering is  
 you do not have any children yet  
 well i have three children and i have used various different kinds of daycare over the years i think actually the hardest time to find good daycare is when your baby is very young  
 because they cannot tell you what is going on the worst experience i had was when i was working  
 when my oldest child was a baby  
 and i thought and i jus- i used the lady next door to me and you know it was close-by and it was convenient and he always came home clean and what have you  
 but i discovered that her way of handling conflicts between little kids once they started crawling and stuff was very different from what i wanted  
 for my son she always interfered and i understand that when you have  
 you know when you have a bunch of kids and you have to make sure that they are all taken care of and everything else you cannot let  
 things escalate but  
 she would deprive the environment in order for the kids not to fight and then just stick them in front of the t v  
 and i i- you know and i did not discover that until later on and but it was summer i decided to quit working anyway but  
 i decided that actually the- the hardest time to find daycare is up to eighteen months old maybe from six weeks to six months you can do it but once your baby starts crawling and stuff from then until they really start talking  
 it is i- i find that is the hardest time to find  
 really comfort- right now they are seven five and three  
 yeah  
 so but then once they are eighteen months old you can often find good preschool  
 kinds of situations but i think it is real important to check  
 how you want social interactions handled and how the school or daycare does it  
 you know the other things to check they always tell you you know check to make sure that there is continuity of care that your child is gonna  
 have somebody that they can make an attachment to and stick with  
 well i used something sort of like a daycare center for my youngest one when i went back to school last year  
 and it was something that was partially funded by the school and it was at a y w c a  
 and that was pretty good the biggest problem i had there actually was that they  
 they try to provide continuity of care but they kept changing the number of people that were in the program you know people would drop out of school and so their kids would drop out of the program and they sent me on and so  
 and somebody would get sick and they would start shifting people around from one room to the next  
 and  
 that was really tough on my son because he had made a real strong attachment with one particular caregiver and then that one  
 got switched out of his room but he he adjusted to it pretty well but that that was tough on him and they they  
 did their best not to do that it was just that you know they kept having  
 because they were using students to provide the care and because of the population of people who were using the care that became  
 much more of an issue with them yeah  
 well in other words they should have the same person taking care of them  
 okay so that they the same faith the same and see different people even if  
 a daycare center or a home or a school or something has a philosophy  
 as to how to deal with certain kinds of situations  
 not every individual applies that philosophy in the same way  
 and so it is nice for kids to have  
 a chance to get used to  
 how things are going to happen  
 so that they they- ne- an- they have a chan- they can start learning to predict a little bit i know real little ones do not do very much predicting but  
 they should have a chance to say yes okay  
 i am gonna get there and this is gonna happen and this is gonna happen and if i do this  
 an- that is gonna happe- you kno- they should have a way to be able to predict what is gonna happen to them  
 and if you keep changing the people who are there then they have no- nothing to hold on to  
 and it is hard enough on little ones to be away from the parents  
 and then different children too have different different ways of handling it one thing  
 i think that parents really d-  
 okay i personally do not know a whole lot i am o- i am twenty-one years old and i do not have any children  
 so but i have baby-sat and stuff and i think about having children so how about you  
 um-hum  
 oh really  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 oh we- uh-huh  
 um-hum  
 oh wow  
 um-hum  
  
 um-hum  
 the hard time how old are your children  
 oh wow  
 that is nice  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 right what other kinds of of things have you used have you ever used like a daycare center type thing or  
 um-hum  
 oh that is nice  
 oh  
 um-hum  
 wow  
 um-hum  
 wow so you would- it sounds like the most important issue is the continuity of care what- what do you m- i- mean when you say that ex-  
 oh i see that makes sense that makes se-  
 um-hum  
 that makes sense yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 right um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 well we have a budget we get paid every two weeks and i have certain bills at certain times  
 you know i either first of or the middle of the month  
 and i pay the bills according to that and then what i- k- and then i budget like our savings i budget that out and daycare i budget that out because i am a college student  
 and so i have to be real careful how we handle the money but i- we yes we live from paycheck to paycheck too  
 unfortunately  
 i s-  
 i sure am in nursing school  
 yeah  
 i sure do i am the main person  
 since we got married about ten years ago  
 um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 well we budget our- our purchases like if we are gonna buy a refrigerator for example and we had to take a loan for that then i- i- d- deciding how quick i wanted to pay it off or what i could afford i would double the payment  
 and maybe pay it off in a year or six months  
 and so i would figure out and that is the only way we have been able to buy big items  
 it seems like you know u- if we need furniture then you know a bedroom suite then we need to budget it  
 and then you know you g- meet the most payment we can meet and yet still do okay  
 everything  
 um-hum one step at a time  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 overa- i write it out every time and i might sometimes even do it a paycheck ahead  
 just to figure out next time in the next two weeks what i will have left over and then wh- how i can use that money  
 according to what we need  
 i am not going to tell you we are not maxed out because being in college i am  
 i mean you know we are living a- at a rate tha- which is barely getting by until i graduate and then we will be able to double our income  
 i am looking forward to it  
 but even in that way we figured if we just turn all my paychecks over and budget it into the bills we will have every bill including our car and truck paid off in like four months  
 i- you know so that is kind of what we are looking at  
 now that is not including student loans but those loans are so much cheaper that budget-wise they are smart to keep those till last  
 they certainly are seven or eight percent  
 yeah well could not make it without those  
 but- but even so i kind of budget like what i will be able to p- afford even when i graduate how much those loans are gonna add up to be  
 you know so that i know exactly what i will be p- owing  
 no we have been doing this for so long now  
 that um i just automatically can tell  
 i- it was  
 no we have always done this i- i do not know how or why we- u- when we first got married we wanted lots of things  
 and the only way we could afford to get those lots of things was to do it this way  
 okay for four months we are gonna buy a refrigerator so for four months we are gonna channel all the money into that  
 you know what i am saying  
 okay then there it is paid now we are gonna buy a t v  
 you see what i am saying  
 and for three months we are gonna channel all the money into that  
 and it is not to say that we waited and got the money first and bought it  
 we have took loans got it and then paid the loans  
 op- but of course  
 yes  
 my- my folks gave us a pretty good allowance but i got married pre-  
 the topic is budgets all right  
 we h- we do not have a budget our family does not we just i do the bills in our family and we have basically live from paycheck to paycheck i mean i know  
 we have pretty much maxed ourselves out we know how much money we have coming in and that is about how much money we have going out every every month how about you  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 do you go to college right now you are in college now  
 oh wow do you handle the finances in your dep- in your family  
 wow  
 how long have you been operating on a budget  
 oh really  
 i tried it once but it just did not seem i mean it was pretty depressing some months it looked like i mean i would have a negative when i compared how much money we had coming in to how much money we had going out  
 i mean i know theoretically how that happens but it would turn out to be like there would be negatives and it got pretty depressing  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 yeah  
  
 yeah  
 then it has worked for you how many large things have you bought that way  
 oh really  
 well y-  
 we have been kind of hit and miss i guess and we know when we have a bill that is fixing to be  
 paid off that we will have it this extra amount coming in and of course something else will come along  
 we do get loans and we do basically the same thing but we ne- i do not put it on paper i just  
 i am i c- i am very financially  
 equipped mentally you know i mean i am i know how to do these things and i can sit down and write it out but it just does not seem to work out for us  
 oh yeah  
 uh-huh  
  
 yeah  
 yeah that will be great when you do my sister just graduated from medical college so i know that will that will be great for you  
 i bet  
 uh-huh  
 gosh  
 yeah  
 right right  
 uh-huh  
 yeah they are f- they are financed at a pretty low interest rate most of the time are not they  
 yeah i-  
 that is a good deal  
 no no  
  
 do you spend a lot of time though mapping out your budget and  
 trying t-  
 yeah  
 do you remember when you got started what how it was then i mean  
 did it seem difficult  
 yeah  
 yeah  
  
 um-hum  
 yes  
 uh-huh  
  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 but you budget the loan into your  
 were you doing this before you got married when you were like where on your own or managing your own money before you got married were you  
 doing a budget then  
 well i used to be a teacher and i think there are many things wrong with the public school system and that is why i got out of teaching  
 well i think the main problem is there is just not enough discipline and the classes are too big  
 because  
 kids just get away with too much and there is not  
 really that much that a teacher can do because  
 the administration is worried about the big problems about you know kids bringing guns to school  
 and they do not have time to worry about the p- the problems of  
 of management that they used to be able to worry about  
 well i think n- the problem with that the problem i had because when i went into teaching i decided that i was just gonna be you know the perfect creative teacher and  
 my kids were gonna just think that learning was fun and  
 i was teaching eighth grade  
 yes  
 well this was in south carolina  
 but anyway the problem that i had  
 was my students did not really know how to respond to that and  
 they basically  
 did not they did not appreciate everything i was trying to do for them because i would have  
 learning games all the time and i tried to do just fun things and make it interesting and do creative thinking  
 just all kinds of things and they just took advantage of me and they walked all over me and i was never  
 able to establish any kind of discipline because i started out being too nice  
 well see that is the thing is i do not think that they do respect teachers and i am saying that that that well just that the administration in my school did not give me any support and it is like after  
 you know that the students were already taking advantage of me  
 they just told me to just crack down and then they would not support me in that  
 and they just told that the only way that these students would respond would be if i had a completely structured environment and i was miserable  
 doing that  
 um-hum  
 well yo- wonder what were the problems that you found in public school systems  
 yeah  
 we- we- i- i think the problem is that i- if you start concerning yourself more with discipline i think  
 i think teachers\' main goal should be more instead of worrying about discipline is getting t- th- students or you know kids interested in learning because as i can recall where i went to go go- to school  
 most of the teachers were just basically bent on either trying to discipline you and then force you to go through this material and show no really interest i mean in to making it interesting or fun fun and and school were two oxymoron type of word  
 and i think that was basically the problem because they were t- more interes- they built up this type of  
 i do not know this might not be in your case but at least where i went to school a superiority complex where they had to be always more intelligent than their students and it was impossible for students they felt more intimidated  
 when people would ask you know questions that they did not understand themselves so then rather than  
 doing this they would either you know ridicule the student or tell them to shut up or you know this is not what we are covering we are doing this and so certain kids who would be interested in exploring different avenues where just basically shunted because  
 you know there- you know it- they were all more concerned that everybody follows along a certain path although i agree that disciplining is important  
 -nd especially since there are in- in different areas where kids are already grown to  
 a point of rebellion where guns as you mentioned but in general in certain areas i think if i- if they started earlier maybe not in just  
 the high school level but i mean elementary school maybe you have to worry about switchblades instead of guns  
 that the students would you know if the teachers got kids interested more into learning rather than bickering you would elimanate these  
 pseudo-rebel roles that are created  
 because you know if the teacher says do not do this and then kids do it and especially that age they want to be a rebel so they are different they prove themselves by you know going against the establishment type of thing what do you think  
 uh-huh  
 what grade were you teaching  
 oh really  
 w- guns at that level too  
 okay w- this is in north carolina  
 okay  
 um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 really do you think the problem might have originated at an earlier stage that maybe kids were not really taught much to respect you know teachers and also try to get interested  
 um-hum  
 what do you consider camping  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 right the worst  
 um-hum  
 so you mean when you say backpacking you took your tent with you everything on your back  
 oh okay  
 well oh that is what i consider camping too  
 right okay because some people think camping is at the s- camping sites you know that go around in a circle  
 yes so yeah ok- well what some so that was the most recent camping trip you took  
 um-hum  
 really is that like something you do often or  
 um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 okay  
 uh-huh  
 right  
 right exactly i know what you mean  
 um-hum  
 to have a challenge a physical challenge like that yeah i know what you mean i went camping over christmas in the mou- the ouachita mountains  
 th- no that is the border of arkansas and oklahoma  
 and it is really beautiful out there and we went for about  
 u- four days  
 and i froze my butt off it wa- it was freezing  
 well i am not sure what your definition of rugged is  
 oh okay i- it is not quite like that because i have been in the- in colorado it is not quite like that so no i- i would not say it was real rugged moderate just moderate  
 yeah it was just the temperature was so cold and i am i do not like cold  
 temperatures  
 oh and it was so hard to build a fire it was just it was so hard  
 but it was nice to have the challenge i was determined to do this because i was so sick of school by that time i just wanted to get out and  
 whatever  
 yeah yeah so  
 yeah i do too i do not like to do it all the time but once in a while  
 i like that challenge  
 you know  
 and it so you can sleep because i ne- i can never sleep when i am camping  
 oh  
 because of the rain yeah  
 well that is that is pretty miserable yeah at least we- it did not rain on us  
 but we had frost and  
 all that kinds of stuff but  
 i can never get comfortable sleeping  
 unless i am at the beach then that is different  
 yeah that is what i have done  
 have what  
 yes we do yeah yeah  
 um-hum  
 that is nice it is it is hard to find a- you see where i have gone is around corpus christi south padre island  
 and it is still not deserted enough for me but  
 i like beach camping when it is not in the middle of the summer  
 but sort of just the beginning when it is not too warm  
 the mosquitoes yeah and all that kind of stuff but that is the only place i can sleep and be comfortable  
 yeah at the beach  
 so  
 okay can we can we shut off or do we have to wait for the  
 okay all right well nice talking to you too  
 all right bye-bye  
 well we just had spring break here i go to georgia tech and so we took a backpacking trip in the north georgia mountains  
 we went for it- well we planned on going four days and it turned out it was really cold and raining and  
 you know all th- i- all the camping story type type you know horror stories right and so you know basically that was you know what i you know was thinking of  
 yeah your tent and your your dehydrated food and the water pills and everything and you know ba- yo- you know no frills type stuff you know i-  
 yeah yeah out th- out there with a book and a notebook and you know trying to get away from the world or something  
 oh yeah yeah yeah right right uh-huh  
 yeah and i had- i swore i would never go back yeah  
 well i used to do it quite a bit like when i was back in high school  
 and you know when i got into college i really did not have that much of an opportunity to- you know to do it and ev- you know i was in the boy scouts you know when i was a little kid and everything  
 and so we were really  
 you know just going out there to get away and we we underestimated the trail and everything we thought oh well we can do this you know but but we got out there and we are we are out of shape and we sit around too much you know  
 but it- it was really nice to get out you know to- you know just  
 really really  
 um-hum  
 is that in texas  
 i see yeah  
 right  
 was it you know re- pretty rugged  
 well yeah i have been i have backpacked in northern new mexico and the rockies before is it of that  
 yeah yeah  
 yeah yeah  
  
 right and no matter how big you build the fire there is no way that you can  
 right right  
 um-hum  
 really yeah  
 yeah and and that is good that is good well i yeah i really enjoy camping  
 and  
 um-hum  
 yeah yeah  
 but it was really nice to get back with a telephone and the city and everything and you know yeah  
 well i- the only way i could bear it was to pass some to be asleep i was like well it is not gonna be- get over until you know w- w- yeah it re- really i th- i think that is what ruined it for us  
 yeah yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 um-hum yeah  
 all the bea- yeah i u- i have heard of some people that have camped actually on beaches like some of the b-  
 some well y\'all have got barrier islands in texas too do not you  
 barrier islands you now on the- on the gulf some of them along georgia like you can go down and you know camp for extended periods out like uninhabited type stuff  
 yeah yeah  
 um-hum  
  
 uh-huh  
 and not to- a- and and then i suppose the flies are not as bad and yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah oh  
 okay well it was good to talk to you  
 okay i think this is my second time doing it i think we just hang up and say goodbye  
 okay  
 good to talk to you bye  
 have children then dorothy  
 uh-huh  
 oh boy  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh what kinds of things did you family things did you do  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh zo- i- the zoo is a good place to take kids they can really run around in zoos and parks and i just have a baby he is six months our first so we are kind of thinking in the future what we are going to do with our kids and  
 i guess one family activity that we would be interested in would be tennis since both my husband and i are tennis players  
 we will probably spend a lot of time on the tennis court with our kids and  
 a health club we belong to a health club so they have a swimming pool you know you can take the kids and they can swim it is outside  
 so that is kind of a nice activity and then parks now tha- he- since he is just a baby  
 you know where can you go with a baby you know so  
 yeah yeah  
 uh-huh  
 really  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 yeah i guess quite a few families i stay home with my baby and but i guess so many families are so busy with both parents working  
 that- that- that on the weekends they do not really have time for fun activities because they are too busy doing laundry and cutting the lawn and getting caught up  
 for you know the next workweek  
 uh-huh  
 um-hum that is nice that is so i mean i am so i am so happy and fortunate that i can stay home with th- that i am gonna be able to stay home with mine  
 um-hum  
 i feel the same way  
 u- i feel exactly the same way  
 uh-huh  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 excuse me  
 yeah it is  
 we are kind of thinking that some things to do with tiny babies would be like you say zoos petting zoos parks  
 take them to parks we are gonna try to do some traveling with them i do not know how that is gonna be  
  
 well pretty good but he is only six months old too but you know when they start getting a little more rambunctious i do not know how you know they do not like to sit still pretty much i guess  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 oh really  
 oh  
 something must have scared him because i- because my baby is pretty l- it lulls him it kind of calms him down to be in the car and i think that is normal yeah  
 something must have scared that baby about a car that is all that i can it made a loud noise or something  
 yeah that could be  
 that could be because that is real unusual  
 um-hum that is what my mom did too  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 well you know it is so the weather is nice here and so are you so is it in texas my inlaws are in texas and  
 houston  
 and so  
 well they are all grown i- i have two two boys one is married and has i have four ch- grandchildren and the other one is living at home but you know we did do stuff when they were living at home  
 well they are both boys so we did a lot of little league soccer and you know we took trips we went to du- i think we probably f- visited every zoo  
 on the eastern seaboard because we lived in new jersey when w- they were growing up  
 so we did a lot of that stuff we wen- we  
 oh i do not know we we just had a- we did a lot of things together  
 you know  
 aw  
 yeah yeah  
 uh-huh  
 oh that is nice  
 uh-huh  
 well you could make start planning things you know  
 and well that is nice we you know wh- we used to take them they used to like  
 we- a lot of petting zoos you know i mean we must have seen every animal there was to see in th- on the eastern seaboard you know we went to a lot of petting zoos and  
 aeh sometimes we would take them to the amusement park and you know it but we always you know f- spent a lot of time with them and i think that is impor- certainly is important you know and  
 right right  
 yeah  
 right well see it was different when i brought up my kids i well i did not work full-time i worked the- i had usually par- a part-time job you know and usually i was f- i would be home you know when they came home you know it would  
 yeah  
 oh that is good see my daughter-in-law stays home and i you know i am glad because i do not really trust baby-sitters  
 and daycare centers really make me very nervous  
 you know so she stays home with them and she you know they di- you know give the kids a lot of time they have a business and you know they they  
 have a baby-sitter for the kids from like nine to two the- the girl is right across the street and while u- sh- the kids are over there they are  
 doing their business and you know at home which is good so and then on weekends they have you know they take the kids different places it is it is it is nice  
 you know i am not i- i am glad that i was able to stay home you know most of the time  
 and i am glad she is  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 uh-huh well does he is he good in the car  
 right well  
 yeah  
 well it depends some- some ba- some babies do like you know to ride in the car  
 and others now i have a four month old grandson i have not seen him yet they are coming in a couple of weeks  
 they live in south carolina and  
 i- they a- she tells me that the minute he actually even sees the car he starts screaming he does not even have to get in it the minute he knows he is going in it he is- he he hates it for some reason i do not know why  
 yeah most of them it does it it does i do not know why he  
 u- a- well i do not know he has got three sisters maybe they scared him me- you know  
 yeah it is because i know my kids in fact when my kids could not sleep at night we we would stick them in the car and in the car seat take a ride and you know we would come back and they were sleeping you know but  
 i do not know but you are dis- you are in a great place to do stuff i mean there is oh  
 yes  
 oh what part  
 oh uh-huh  
 so i guess they were talking taxes  
 well here is a rough one that everybody disagrees on i am sure  
 i am sure i am sure you fully agree with the amount of taxes you pay right uh-huh  
 yeah right  
 oh really oh do you really  
 well what about these these guys  
 i guess the the candidate\'s coming up i heard brow- brow- brown\'s little suggestion there he wanted what thirteen percent across the board  
 that was interesting  
 an- i also think it yeah really and i th- it sounds pretty simplistic too  
 get that to work with all those special interests work special interests groups that is a good deal  
 that will that will it is like when pigs fly  
 um-hum  
 oh right right  
 yeah i am sitting here in the worst position that i possibly could be in terms of taxes and you know renting single twenty five professional right  
 right in the major zingo the only thing that has helped me is i got a lot of money in tax free stuff so  
 yeah i went into the i do not know what you think of fidelity but  
 went with one of their spartan f- spartan funds so  
 it it did all right yeah  
 bonds i got to get out of bonds though  
 get out of bonds now get back into stocks  
 but  
 yeah i know i know that is what hurts but they do- i a- everybody tells me oh jeez and everything say well get married and i say i am not getting married just to lower my taxes and then k- decrease my insurance  
 that is what it comes down to say it is ni- it is a nice plus as a side effect but f- as a reason i will wait  
 oh really how old are you  
 oh okay  
 um-um oh what do you teach  
 oh okay  
 right right  
 that is me i am still middle class  
 and you- you are working the you are doing it too so you we- you are pulling in two incomes that will probably stick you right in the middle too  
 with three kids  
 yeah there you go there you go  
 now you have just been recorded saying that  
 yeah i do a little under the table on the side myself on stuff mostly vehicle work but  
 yeah it is stuff that tax-free stuff is nice un- unofficial tax-free stuff  
  
 that is right  
 well that is that is the thing  
 the- there was they have hit i- it is funny that they went with the i guess the reagonomics called for trickle-down theory i think that is pretty m- pretty pretty much disproven at this point  
 so we have gone this many years it is pretty much trashed  
  
 it is a- from what i see  
 well have you seen the division of wealth figures lately something like the top one percent have the top  
 some ungodly or the top one percent have forty percent or the top ten percent have forty percent of the wealth  
 and like the top one percent have like twenty five percent or something  
 and it is just getting worse for the n- with this tax structure  
 so  
 right  
 right  
 in the top one percent  
 and it they- they always cry they always cry that  
 you know that that well you know if you would tax the rich more you are actually not getting that much more money because there are not that many of them whereas you are getting a lot of money from from the  
 from all the  
 middle class because even though you are taking less from each one there is so many mo-  
 oh oh definitely a hundred percent no definitely not no i do tax preparing on the side so i am one of these people that try to get back every penny they take out yeah  
 so you know i am the one- i am one of those that try to find every way around them possible  
 um-hum  
 yeah the very interesting only i have a funny feeling it is not going to end up across the board once the big companies get involved  
 um-hum yeah yeah  
 uh-huh  
 yeah it is just like i i know we just heard about the oh up here there is a big scandal involving the united fund and what the president of the united fund was raking in tax-free  
 and it was like yeah right this is nice  
 uh-huh  
 oh god  
 oh  
 you fall right in the major zingo  
 uh-huh that is the only way to go  
 oh that is great  
 i know  
 yeah  
 yeah get back into back into the stocks  
 i know it is terrible you cannot find any way around it because as soon as you find a way around it they c- start plugging up the holes  
 really  
 well i am  
 um-hum  
 no well i am divorced and i have three kids so i have the write-off on the three kids  
 i am thirty seven  
 but i am i am professional i am a teacher and  
 i teach secondary ed and english  
 and it is it is really difficult to try to figure out what you are going to do because you fall right smack dab in the middle class  
 and you get zapped the most of just about everybody  
 um-hum  
 no- not enough to get any  
 yeah  
 well most of the you know the tax stuff is under the table that is the only way you can make anything  
 i know  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 right  
 that is the only to go otherwise you cannot make it i do not know they have got to come up with something and hit some of the big companies and lower it on the middle class  
 right  
 um-hum  
 yeah they have got to come up with something new and different  
 um-hum  
 right  
 um-hum  
 that is exactly it well it is just the same as the new tax codes that just came out if you make over a hundred and seventy five thousand a year you are limited on your what you can get back you know as far as taking off for your deductions  
 and i said who in the h- god\'s name makes that much money you know and that is about it and th-  
 what was the last the remodeling or home project that you have worked on  
 oh  
 yeah that sounds like a good job  
 yeah it might even be enjoyable when the weather gets nice  
 well that is good  
  
 is it an old house  
 oh  
 um-hum  
 i see  
  
 oh boy  
 well i have an old house and i just put a- i did not do it myself i had a new furnace put in just a couple months ago and what- what they had here was an old gravity furnace that was converted into a forced-air gas furnace  
 it- it just did not keep the house warm at all and the fan hardly blew any air through the house so like you i have a- a- a stepped-up fan motor now and it is just incredible the difference it makes with the new furnace  
 you mean in r p m i have no idea to tell you the truth there is four or five settings in it actually we had to turn it down to one of the lower settings because the higher setting did not keep did not let the furnace get hot enough to work efficiently  
 the air was not all that hot  
 it is on one of the lower settings which is still quite a bit more than what we had before  
 right  
 yeah  
 sure  
 yeah oh  
 right right you have to have it then  
 um-hum  
  
 oh boy  
 wakes you up in the middle of the night that sort of thing  
 oh that is good  
 uh  
 not very peaceful  
 um-hum  
 no where you do not need it  
 um-hum  
 oh okay  
 oh that is good well the last major thing we did ourselves was we decided to refinish our bedroom  
 w- to redo the bedroom the downstairs has all natural wood trim but the upstairs all the woodwork was painted we decided we did not like that  
 so we thought we would get ambitious and strip all the paint off of the woodwork and had i known what i was getting myself into i do not think i would have chosen to do that  
 but we started it so we finished it and we also had to tear all this old wallpaper off the walls  
 and that was quite a mess but it- it is nice but we were a little disappointed because after getting all the wood off the paint off the wood upstairs we realized that it was not the same quality wood  
 well let us see  
 the last thing i worked on we will let us see  
 i have not done an awful lot because i just bought my house here  
 i have been planning on doing some work to fix up some of the stuff around here and i have been repairing some lights stuff like that  
 need to i need to seal the back deck  
 since it was a a- a- w- they have allowed it to get a little bit weatherbeaten  
 yeah well it- it has  
 it has it will take a little while but once it gets a little bit warmer i will probably be going into it  
 um-hum yeah the  
 the house was kept in reasonably good re- repair by the people who who i bought it from  
 and but there is a there is a a number of things to do i also need to do some work with the heating and cooling system  
 it does not get very good airflow to the upstairs b- they did not design it very well so i have to put in some fans  
 no actually it is pre- it is fairly new it is just that they did not d- there there just i- is not any airflow to the upstairs because of bad ductwork design  
 also jus- and because of that they upped the fan rate  
 to something i- to very very high which makes it noisy downstairs and wears out the bearings so i just had to replace the bearings last weekend  
 because i had no heat  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 i had one of those at my previous house  
 yeah how fast is it running  
 um-hum  
 right right  
 right  
 yeah  
 yeah m- mine was turned up to fifteen hundred r p m normal is more like you know seven or eight hundred  
 so it gets a lot of airflow downstairs but still almost nothing upstairs it is not that bad in the winter because the heat rises  
 but in the summer f- wh- when it is time for air conditioning it will not be very here very effective  
 so i  
 yeah have to figure out  
 either some way to improve the ducting or s- to put a booster fan going to the upstairs  
 the bearings had on this had worn out  
 to the point where  
 aw  
 it was rattling around rather rather badly and finally just threw it\'s belt off  
 so  
 yeah well it is not that bad because i cannot hear it upstairs but the it is it is  
 it gets to the point where you cannot hear the the televison or talk  
 of- or- or was getting to that point  
 no it it doe- the the furnace does have enough  
 heating and cooling power to- to- so that the airflow is not a problem then whe- i had the inspector  
 check that out and it was cooling th- cooling the air adequately  
 it was just it was all the cooling was going downstairs  
 yeah oh well the i just repaired a light  
 last weekend also  
 you know it ha- it has some hanging glassing panes around it with metal fringing and the metal fringing was like had bent away from the from the glass so they just glued it back together  
 so looks a lot better now  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 oh yeah  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 topic for me i am a music major in college  
 yeah i sing but i also play a couple of instruments i u- started out on the piano and i am taken that for about eleven years and then i took flute then i picked up the fiddle  
 and my latest venture was the guitar but it did not get very far because i am getting burned out on learning instruments  
 i want to go on to graduate school and teach in a university  
 well i am not really interested in that because that requires all of your time and eventually i just want to be settled down you know i am not interested in going on the road or anything like that  
 i have some relatives that are in a gospel singing group and they do that and it is just very time consuming and i just do not know that i would want to get into that but  
 right and i- my goal is to just really learn how to be a good teacher because there is not it is not that easy  
 i am not really sure i have thought about southern methodist university here in texas s m u  
 yes  
 right right but they have a real good music program and i- i have thought about there there is also belmont university in nashville  
 tennessee and that is music city i would i would love to live there  
 oh goodness i listen to a lot of contemporary christian music and there is lornell harris have you heard of him  
 he is just  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 right right  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 right right i like amy grant and sandy patty and lornell harris and some of those but no i sing opera because that is that is what they teach you in college  
 is is opera for the technique so that you will learn how to sing and not ever hurt your voice  
 right right the- the the idea is that opera is the hardest thing to learn how to sing and if you can sing that then you can adjust your voice to sound country or rock or anything else  
 but you cannot just because you can sing rock or country or something else does not mean you can sing opera because it is it is really it is really technical and it is hard to learn  
 no i- right now i am at a junior college but i will be transfering to stephen f austin state university  
 really oh  
 right  
 right  
 oh they have got a real good basketball team right now and they had a real good football team  
 a few years ago we were supposed to talk about music though what kind of music do you like  
 i have heard of it  
 oh yeah  
 uh-huh  
 right  
 uh-huh  
 oh  
 uh-huh  
 see i listen to i like jazz i-  
  
 oh my goodness i don- i do not know it well enough to name off people but some of the older jazz songs  
 i have heard of him  
 okay well see i like to sing jazz i was the hostess at a restaurant here in tyler this past summer and  
 they had a jazz band there on the weekends and  
 they found out i could sing and so they got me up there and i sang on the stage with them on the weekends and just songs like blue moon and ai not misbehavin\' and and songs like that  
 oh  
 oh really  
 okay do you want to do anything obviously you are a music major what do you want to do with that major  
 okay do you do you are you more interested in classical or rock music or are yo- i mean  
 do yo- will yo- would you ever consider recording an album or something like that  
 um-hum  
 oh i see  
 i see that is good though you know give something back you know we need as many good teachers as possible so who-  
 where do you want to go to graduate school  
 yep  
 of course heard of it definitely oh yeah s m u i mean the big athletic powerhouse  
 uh-huh  
 there you go  
 who were some of your like inspirations  
 uh-huh  
 no i have not y- yi- to tell you the truth i am kind of weak i work at a radio station but i am a little weak i- in that department but the only one i guess i really know of i- wi- t- without you know thinking even harder is amy grant because she crossed over  
 so yeah i know o- you know her stuff i have seen a lot of her you know before she went more pop i have seen some of her original stuff and heard it like on m t v and stuff like that well not m t v but channels like m t v  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 if you sing opera does that can that pretty much qualify you to sing anything else  
 i see  
 uh-huh  
 so  
 were you at you said you were at university of texas  
 oh yeah i have heard of that yeah i\'v- i know of all these schools pretty much i guess through their their athletics and stuff like that or their radio stations because i have to deal with that a lot  
 so i do not know but yeah i have- i have heard of stephen f austin so  
 oh that is good that is goo- that is good to know  
 yeah i-  
 oh man i am all over the place i like oh man it is just a wide spectrum yo- you know the what progressive music like alternative progressive  
 it is it is stuff like that is you know it is rock music that is not really quite mainstream it is more college radio  
 because you know i am not i- like most of the stations these days all they do is play classic rock i mean if you do not like that i mean if everyone likes some classic rock but  
 you know alternative is like the new stuff but the kids these days are listening to the same stuff that their parents were pretty much so it is more of a college town alternative like you know that band nirvana  
 they started out as alternative but everyone ended up liking them so i guess they are no longer alternative  
 but you know they are a good sound but i listen to everything i even listen to like rap music i am all over the place  
 so  
 who is your favorite jazz artist  
 who is your favorite jazz artist  
 um-hum  
 yeah i like more older than contemporary have you ever heard of john coltrane  
 yeah he is he is my favorite he is he is excellent  
 uh-huh  
 that is great  
 yeah okay  
 but john coltrane plays the saxophone  
 so he is he is very talented  
 mike do you think the soviet union is still a threat to the united states  
 and there is really not even a soviet union any more i mean it has disintegrated it so sort of a silly question to be asking  
 the  
 a lot depends i guess on whether you are afraid of weapons or if you are afraid of intentions and and you know ideology  
 because  
 i guess a lot of the weapons that we-  
 the u s and the soviet union both built up over decades are still around but  
 right right i mean there have been a- some agreements i think there is start arms control con- treaty cut by thirty to fifty percent or something like that  
 but still you know thousands of weapons remain the question is whether or not  
 we worry about that as much anymore as we used to and i think we are both agreeing that we do not  
 um-hum  
 right  
 right  
 right i mean there is no doubt that because the weapons are there that we worry about the you know if they could be sold on black markets to countries like libya or if  
 you know if there was a another military attempted coup or something like that that seems like a separate question from whether or not the soviet union itself is still a threat to the u s because  
 no soviet union i guess  
 debating about semantics  
  
 what p- what could happen to make it less of a threat i guess was a dou- what air paraphrasing the next question  
 um-hum  
 sort of think if they get integrated into  
 like a western kind of community ess  
 i mean after world war two we stopped worrying eventually about countries like japan and germany by making them more like ourselves  
  
 that is right and  
 i think pepsi and coke are fighting it out  
 yeah get  
 right well that is certainly true  
 and but having access also to on a more widespread scale instead of just the black market or  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah well or go any- elsewhere like i think there have been thousands or hundreds of thousands of jews immigrating to israel in the last couple years now  
 which is something that we pushed them for for twenty years  
  
 you were talking about  
 all these measures that sound sort of  
 domestic i guess if there were further efforts at disarmament or arms control i g- that would probably decrease the threat as well right  
 yeah  
 right  
 right and like we were saying  
 the mayb- the bigger fear may be those weapons falling into the hands of somebody we do not want them to p- you know we we trusted  
 brezhnev and  
 right  
 right right  
 but i ge-  
 probably china  
  
 anyway that that i mean patriot\'s obviously nonnuclear and you could argue that it is defensive  
 but  
 right in yeah i see if you get the defense then you can learn how to overcome it with the offense well that that makes sense i guess  
 but that that is still a little different than worrying about if soviet scientists suddenly start taking up residence in north korea and libya and  
 places we still worry about  
  
 yeah  
 actually no i don- i mean i think with all the the changes going on over there the move towards democracy it seems like things are getting better  
 no-  
 yeah  
 that is right  
 yeah they are being reduced sli- somewhat but  
 yeah  
 and i guess there is legitimate concern like i mean it is just from a t v show last night but that you wonder who is in charge over there because  
 we- the instability anybody could take over at any time it seems  
 right  
 right  
  
  
 perhaps  
 we- if the- if the economy gets better then they- then they can  
 they are more on their on- on enou-  
 i guess that is something separate maybe  
 i mean just basically i- if things get better over there and they are  
 if the people  
  
 are happy with the government and do not like try to overturn it or or over-  
 right  
 right yeah now that we got mcdonald\'s over there now so  
 right  
 anywhere uh it they are m- they are moving in to more of a western culture  
 yeah and also maybe more of a  
 understanding and exchange between west and and and east  
  
 like  
 which seems to be happening i guess more freedom to- to travel over there and to- for them to come over here  
 yeah  
 right  
 yeah  
 yeah definitely  
 because like  
 kind of the way it works it is like  
 the- both sides having the weapons is a deterrent supposed to be an aterr- deterrent itself  
 so that  
 the one side\'s got the same amount as the other i- it  
 it is probably the l- the li- the likelihood of p- of one country using their weapons if another are probably pretty slim  
 so there is a de- it is kind of like  
 to balance out the powers  
 right  
 like  
 saudi arabia selling the patriot missles or possibly or may- or maybe it was israel i am not sure who selling the patriots over to to china i think it was  
 to china or japan  
 yeah  
 right  
 but that could they could use that to learn how  
 to  
 oh well they the thing wa- the concern was that china supplies weapons to the middle east  
 eh  
 right  
 right  
 -ou\'ve already gotten your pee- your pin and stuff like that from time to time you will get a call well you notice that you got a message from the switchboard saying if you are ready to receive a call i guess or things like that i have actually never gotten  
 picked up the phone and picked that up because i am doing this from home and usually it is another member of the family that gets it and they get a chance to i think enter a two or a three or something like that if you are forty five seconds away or something like that  
 basically though after figuring out a little bit on the topic we- usually the the way it works is the caller  
 hits the one key and we record for about oh it goes for about four minutes or so and then we get a recorded voice saying we are out of recording capability please finish up your conversation  
 so  
 do you  
 oh yeah i have got lots and i assume that you do some so i- if okay good well let us go ahead a- i will get the recording started and then we can go from there probably sound good to you  
 sounds good  
 okay  
 aw  
 there should not be any problem i think you will find that we can use up the five minutes about like the blink of an eye  
 a- we can probably use up five minutes talking about things in the blink of an eye it will go much faster than you think  
 okay  
 okay here we go well we are canarst we are talking about camping i boy it- it- that is one of my f- the favorite things in my life  
 right  
 oh sounds great i- i have never had a chance to backpack around aspen although i did do some packing into the lost valley wilderness area which is oh a hundred miles or so south of that  
 i think that is what it is called  
 oh essentially west of boulder not boulder fort collins  
 no wait a minute not fort collins either colorado springs you can tell it was it was that was twenty years ago it was my wife and i were on a honeymoon as a matter of fact we did three months of  
 driving and backpacking in the united states for a honeymoon which which is why i am a real fan of camping i guess partly  
 unfortunately my backpacking experience has not been as good recently be- mainly because the type of camping i have been doing has been with the boyscouts and boyscout backpacking is a far cry  
 yeah actually last summer i had a chance to just take about one group of six and one group of seven out on a single overnight and it turned out to be  
 just beautiful weather and nobody had any real trouble the the worst trouble that we had was  
 one boy we got about oh we walked about five miles or so on easy trail about halfway there we stopped for a break and i told every every boy to bring two canteens just to make sure because water was not  
 quite very plentiful this was in northern idaho it was time for a break and the one fellow said oh boy am i thirsty and he s- well why do not you have some water  
 why i did not bring any water i just brought the canteens  
 no i have not gotten that sophisticated on it sounds like you have done some things like that  
 yeah uh-huh  
 right uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 i see  
 okay well great  
 yeah are y- do you do much camping  
 i do indeed  
 yeah i can ju-  
 sure we can talk about i do not know why i do not know equipment and places and i do not know what all but i will what wait a minute what i will do is hang on a second here  
 is what i would like to do  
 i- my wife has somewhat better memory than i do and if i can get her to just jot down some reminders for me as we are talking it will help me is that all right can you do that  
 just ju- all things we- do- camping and just you know places we have been and other neat things i can tell him about the yeah okay  
 say again  
 okay and i suspect okay  
 okay  
 well it takes place with me with respect to competition with other things i am one of those people that you know he who dies with the most toys wins  
 and oh we have a fair number of toys  
 one of my favorite backpacking stories is when my wife and i took a trip from crested butte up over the hill into aspen  
 and what we had done is we had sent some civvies or civilian clothes so to speak on ahead to a hotel in aspen and we backpacked over the mountains  
 took us three days or so and got into aspen and donned our civvies and rented a old clunker tandem bike and rode around aspen on the bike  
 and when the after the next day  
 put our camping clothes back on and mailed our civics civvies back home and climbed back over the mountain  
 yeah  
 lost valley  
 where i- where is lost valley  
 fort collins oh  
 oh  
 colorado springs  
 uh-huh  
 hmm  
 sounds good  
 yes i am sure you had to deal with all the boyscouts  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 no no speaking of weather do you carry a altimeter slash barometer  
 i have as a matter of fact one of the neat parts of the aspen trip was  
 -here are you in new jersey  
 okay yeah i am a little bit north of you in morristown  
 yeah  
 so in general how do you feel  
 um-hum  
  
 yeah  
 yeah we just wrote it on our school board budget yesterday  
 it passed it had a two percent increase  
 which was you know pretty modest compared to the  
 municipal budget that went up eleven percent wit-  
 no increase in services so  
 school board is doing a little bit better job this year than that- the township administration  
 yeah w- we have one of the highest we- i am in the morris school district and we have about seventy five hundred dollar per pupil expenditure which is i think  
 about two thousand dollars more per pupil than the state average  
 but  
 f- i have several friends in school business administration and they all you know tell me that  
 that seventy five hundred is not out of line considering the size of the district and the diversity of the population and the richness of the programs and everything  
 in fact one in particular is th- was the business administrator for randolph district which was listed by one of the  
 by a magazine as one of the top districts in the country  
 and that he chose to live in morris school district so he could have his child go there so that was a prett- pretty strong vote in favor of our of a- l- at least that portion of our money  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 getting value for that yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah that is that is part of the frustrating  
 areas of of this topic is i do not have a whole lot of problem with the total amount of tax i pay and i have no idea of what that is f- by the way  
 as i am sitting here thinking about it i have no idea i do not know whether i end up paying thirty percent or fifty percent of my total wages in taxes when you when you think of income and social security and state tax and  
 and local tax and then sales tax  
 i suspect it is you know prett- pretty high up there forty fifty percent  
 but i mean my standard of living is high and i you know i get police protection and garbage pickup and you know what else do i need  
 what i do not know though is if that tax money is being spent efficiently and effectively  
 and i am i am sure as in any business things could improve but i do not know overall whether i am getting full value for that tax dollar  
 i- i just d- i-  
 i do not have any f- way of of really determining that unless you get into the nitty gritty of a budget and see where every dollar goes  
 how you gonna know  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 i mean i  
 yeah just just a  
 you know a couple of almost anecdotal things i know new jersey has more school districts than any other state  
 w- which is incredible given our size not only the population but the density and the and the territory but we have more school districts that any other s-  
 i am in northern new jersey in berkeley heights r-  
 oh really  
 yeah  
 well  
 well i feel my real estate taxes are exhorbitant  
 and i think a lot of that is due to school taxes  
 from what i understand new jersey has the highest education cost per pupil  
 over the entire united states i think even including alaska where you might expect the cost to be higher  
 and i am not exactly sure what that can be attributed to i think it is a l- lot of it is  
 administrative costs because teachers do not really get paid any more than  
 other you know states in the northeast  
 but i think you get administrators i think we have overloaded with administrators  
 so i think education costs are really one of the big expenses in new jersey and and  
 yeah  
 oh really  
 yeah  
 yeah i- i think that is true i think the they have stabilized the the school board costs  
 our municipal costs have have stabilized too but i think they are just enormous to start out from  
 really yeah  
 um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 yeah well i have nothing to i-  
 right the quality of education i think is is reasonably good i just think we are paying too much for it my wife happens to be a a learning disabilities consultant  
 and i give her a a lot of grief because it is it is one of these programs that are mandated by the state  
 she does no teaching she does a lot of paper work and trying to screen pupils who need extra help  
 and it is it is very labor intensive and a lot of paperwork and i- i- i often wonder whether there we are  
 we are really getting our money\'s worth for for helping these students i think they have to be helped in some way but i am i am i am just wondering whether the process is really efficient and that is just one of the kinds of services that we are really paying for  
 um-hum  
 i am sure it is  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 right well we are lay people and we we really do not know and i think school boards  
  
 sort of have inertia too they they accept what is given to them too by their experts their administrators and just pass it on i do not think anyone has really gone into depth to try to see just what can be done to make it more efficient  
 um-hum  
 what do you normally wear every day how do you normally dress  
 okay  
 well i do like to dress up i am not one for wearing sweats to school i do not  
 believe in like going out in sweats because i can wear them at home but i- i do like to wear jeans you know and i- when i go to school sometimes i wear  
 like a nice shirt with jeans i try and you know if i am wearing one casual item then i i  
 wear a nicer item on top or if i wear jeans than i i skip the tennis shoes i wear like nice shoes and then maybe i will wear like  
 you know nice socks that  
 you know kind of  
 what i- what will can i say kind of dress up the outfit a little more  
 kind of like that  
 you know i  
 no  
 yeah i am  
 i do not know if i even if i did wear those again i would i would combine it with  
 like a nicer item  
 just because  
 i am always  
 you know i try not to be too into clothing and into makeup and things like that and i have gotten a lot better but  
 it is stuff the since i might be going into the peace corps i- i am not even buying clothes but  
 what i what i like to do is just  
 i do not know kind of look like i care what i look like  
 you know  
 yeah what are you planning on doing in the future tha- that would change your dressing style or that  
 oh  
 sure  
 sure  
 um-hum i see  
 yeah do you li-  
 i am sorry  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 well i just wanted to what was i going to ask you  
 i just wanted to ask you if  
 you like the way that business cloth- th- clothing line for business clothing i do not know if you have seen much of it but do you like the styles that they put out  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah that does look nice  
 i can- i- that is one way i cannot see myself dressing as just  
 having to be real  
 you know too professional i have like this fear of having to dress  
 you know to conform too much you know even though i like to dress up i- i kind of like what is it wha- what is the way i could- i like the way new yorkers dress kind of like that  
 you know  
 they are kind of  
 yeah it has it has you know it has got some meaning to it it is i- it is not too outrageous yet it is  
 it is them  
 that is the way i always see new yorkers dressing  
 yeah yeah  
 but  
 for a while there i was into too much p- you know like black and earth tones and now i am going to and  
 get away from that and try to dress a little more brighter  
 yet i do not go for the pastels just because it kind of washes me out and  
 and i am just not a pastel person  
 um-hum  
 yes yes  
 and it is just a much more cheerful  
 what di-  
 i normally  
 yeah i think you know a pair of earrings adds  
 lately i have been really slacking off with that but  
 it is like i just have not had the money but as far as accessories i like them  
 you know when i come across some i just  
 you know i guess i probably add more to my wardrobe with them that is probably true  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 yes the-  
 oh my problem is i am a student so i do not go to work so i do not have a dress code so i am usually in jeans and a sweatshirt or something like that  
 unless i am giving a pre- presentation then i you know wear a skirt or something try to make it look a little more dressy how about you  
 um-hum so you get not the kind that wears the jeans that are are ripped at the knees  
 yeah i am not either yeah  
 exactly how you are you are neat- neatly dressed  
 yeah  
 well next year i go to graduate school i do not wanna become a teacher right now i am a biochemistry major th- right now i am in the lab which is the reason for wearing messy clothes  
 next year i am gonna try to look older more intelligent  
 so then i will be wearing more of- business style clothing  
 not not on the level of suits but dresses skirts nice sweaters  
 nice slacks  
 co-  
 oh thought you were going to say definitely my life style has  
 influenced what i have worn  
 so how about you  
 i have not seen much but i like more of a tailored look crisp and tailored  
 you know not men\'s wear so much you know feminine but  
 not all the ruffley stuff and  
 big bangly necklaces i do not go for that  
 for the tailored you know m- more of a straight skirt i like that  
 hmm yeah  
 yeah a little bit of a flair to it  
 right  
 right not like everybody else a little different another view on personality  
 so do you go for bright colors or are you more of a neutral  
 right yeah i like the bright colors i think they look cheerful especially when wintertime comes and the sun seems to go down for months on end yeah  
 yeah i think so too  
 so do you go for all the accessories  
 right yeah i like them but right now like yeah i i do not have the money for them so i do not have any just like i do not have many shoes you know i have basically you know tan black white not not much of a selection  
 lanier  
 yeah  
 oh that is okay are you ready okay here we go  
 are you employed  
 and i okay do you hav- do you think you have pretty good benefit  
 oh  
 okay  
 um-hum  
 well now see i work for a large inc- company and my husband does also but our health insurance costs p-  
 over a hundred dollars a month  
 yeah we just have it with his company we do not have double coverage i do not see any need to have double coverage but the- it is like a hundred and forty  
 and then dental is fifty something extra so it is almost a hundred a month  
 uh that is the best hot- that is extremely high but i w-  
 other than than the pay i think  
 the benefits vacation paid sick leave and th- and  
 i think those are are wonderful things to have but i think in a big company  
 they lose touch with the employee  
 and you are not a person anymore and they do not  
 they do not think of you as a person with  
 like they do not want you making personal phone calls  
 on their phone even though you have a child at home that is sick and you need to call  
 so it you know i- i think that there is a swap-off there with small companies and large companies  
 um-hum  
 yeah the- which we had this past week but see i had to take a week of vacation this past week because of spring br- break but  
 now at times my husband is can get away with taking our son to his job for a day  
 but he could not do it on a regular basis you know  
 but i could never get away with that  
 you know in fact we we had a timecard and all this kin-  
 punch a timeclock and all this kind of thing all of which i think is is real degrading  
 you know and there is a set time at lunch and breaks and all  
 twenty five years and it is office i am an office employee you know i am not a not in the warehouse or anything like that  
 but  
 anyway there is there is always  
 those people that have a limited amount of power and they they like to  
 have their egos stroked  
 um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 well the company must have paid a lot  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 that is okay  
 uh-huh  
 yeah yeah now see my husband\'s company does that they will  
 through his credit union you can have the payments for the car or savings or whatever deducted but  
 yeah yeah you never get it my the company i worked for we had a credit union and the interest was a little lower as far as loans and things but tha-  
 -anier or burton  
 lanier okay see i do not even know  
 um-hum  
 oh yes i am  
 n- no i have horrible benefits i do not even have we do not have benefits i work for a very small company there is a total of about fifteen people  
 so that it is real hard i mean i c- i could for instance i could have health insurance but it would cost a hundred dollars a month  
 really  
 no  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 hm  
 wow  
 that is true the the atmosphere that i work in is very casual and  
 it is very easy a li- in fact it is a woman owned and operated company and there is a few women that work there that have children and they are very very nice about  
  
 you know if your child is sick and you cannot you know or if you have to leave early even if it is every da- you know when they are on spring break maybe you can only come in half days and stuff like that they are  
 um-hum  
 right  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 especially if you have worked there for a long time and they know that you are dependable  
 um-hum  
  
 yeah well i the same i did the same thing that i do now for a big company before i worked he- there and it was a place called atlanta blueprint and anyway it was just it was more than a hundred people working there and we and the benefits were much better there  
 for instance i could get heal- health insurance which i had then because it was only six dollars a week it was taken directly out of your paycheck  
 and you know the only reason they could afford to do it is because it is such a huge company  
 and they but they wanted to make it something  
 affordable they you know they knew that it would not do any  
 it would not yeah it would not do any good to for it to be an amount like where i work now it- you can get that independently you can get that kind of insurance  
 for that amount independently you do not even it is not even a benefit you know really but how annoying someone is trying to call me on the other line but  
  
 oh and also we had a credit union which is the best thing that ever that i have ever  
 as far as the benefits go i never had really actually used used the health insurance but as far as the  
 credit union you could have money taken directly out of your salary you could buy stock for one thing through- that way having money taken directly out of your salary or and also you could with the credit union you could  
 you put money aw- even if the- the- minimum was ten dollars a week but af- for awhile i was putting twenty five dollars away and before you know it it adds up  
 and if it if you do not see it the it is you do not even think that you have it yeah  
 well i have two children how about you  
 oh you have got a good household then  
 i would ima- well yeah it is i know you are able to stay home with them  
 i do not either my wife gets to stay home and i think it is a good thing so  
 she gets to spend well most of the day you know there is always things that come up but  
 with with  
 few exceptions she is she is there when she needs them or when they need them and right there i have two little girls one is four  
 and the other is two in a couple weeks  
 and  
 s- my time with them is not what i would like it to be actually i get to spend  
 we- every night i read to them they like that and that takes about half an hour and that is  
 probably er what i cons- would consider the best time that i have with them  
 well they like it you know that is that is the way we settle them down and get them into bed and  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 well they she likes it and and she knows that it is important to us in fact my four year old is is now reading along with us  
 so a- and tha- and that is because f- you know we have been able to spend the time and and she has found that it is enjoyable so now we kind of trade off i read to her and she reads to me  
 which is  
 well actually th- she- she can pick up a book now that is brand new and and  
 read along  
 she is pretty remarkable that way  
 but our- our two year old  
 she knows her alphabet so you know it starts pretty early i think  
 because that is the books that she likes she likes lists of things  
 but  
 other than that you know in terms of f- family time we spend  
 oh you know dinnertime and i will sometimes come back to work and then go back for their bedtime and then usually i am around weekends  
  
 so  
 i- i think they are not suffering too badly  
 yeah  
 yeah because then you know they are not getting any instruction except from the t v which is not the place to get it  
 um-hum  
 a lot of them especially in in like the cities where there are lots and lots of kids and lots of pressure to- for the parents to go out and work  
 um-hum  
 we have six  
 yes we do and it it is  
 actually a very time consuming business raising children  
 yes i am i am it is i do not know how people with big families are able to do anything but i mean if they have to work  
 i do not know how they keep track of their children  
 uh-huh  
 well and from what you have what i read and hear that is probably the best  
 one of the best things you can do with your children take the time  
 uh-oh and they probably look forward to that every night  
 i know my children were the same way i- mine are quite a bit older a- a lot of them i have a senior  
 and and he is the oldest and then my youngest is a se- is a first grader this year and the little girls which are my two youngest they really like to spend that time just before bed being read to and having  
 having that personal time with parents when there is nobody else interfering  
 and when you have a large family that is kind of hard to spend a- individual time with each child but  
 it is  
 it is something i remember when i was young  
 that is the times i remember the best are when my parents were with me just before i went to bed at night  
 singing songs and reading stories and  
 sometimes just talking but i remember those times the best so  
 i think that is an important thing to do  
 then you are on the right track  
 oh  
 that is pretty good  
 yeah  
 you read the same story long enough they eve- even can memorize it  
 and even pick out the words  
 that is that is really  
 tha-  
 that is a good accomplishment for a four year old a lot of children do not learn how to read until they get into school  
 uh-huh  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 well i always felt like as long as one parent was home with them  
 the majority of the time  
 the other parent can fill in when he when he or she  
 can and and have some good quality time with them and it is still it is still okay it is the children that come home to empty houses that worry me  
 that is right  
 and you wonder  
 i just know what happens when my children get home from school and if i was not here  
 i would miss out on so many important  
 things that i hear when they when they first come home  
 and i drive up the road after school sometimes to take my children to lessons piano or whatever and i see  
 several households where the children come home and there is no one there  
 and they just all kind of pack out together you know and run the neighborhood and  
 until the parents come home a couple of hours later and  
 i just think you know if i i am i am really really glad that that is not what happens at my house because  
 i kind of think that where the the problems are coming from  
 lots and lots of kids are on their own  
 it does i- i- it  
 i- i- it is i think part of the problems of wh- what the youth are going through today  
 okay care of the elderly  
  
 i have not had any personal experience with that luckily  
 but i am only twenty seven and my parents are in their  
 mid to late fifties an- and i have already you know discussed it tried to discuss it with them  
 and they kind of pooh pooh me and tell me to shut up you know  
 but i have got a- a girlfriend whose grandfather has already made all kinds of arrangements if he needs some sort of long term care he will be able to get it  
 and has shifted all his assets and things because if you have any assets  
 sometimes you cannot get you know the kind of financial help from the government that one would hope you would get but anyway  
 yeah see do you have any personal experience with this  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 oh uh-huh  
 well that is good that is a blessing then  
 really  
 well it is nice that he has family around you know so then maybe that is not the only option  
 you know for so many people it is the only option and  
 i know here in raleigh recently in wake county around raleigh there was one nursing home that th- was going to be closed  
 because of neglect of- of patients and and there were some questionable deaths at the home  
 and it really makes you think you know  
 you got  
 um-hum  
 and then they are not taking good care of you  
 yeah that is that is kind of scary and i  
 i do not know i would certainly interview  
 these places  
 you know and ask them lots and lots of questions and you know one thing they say about when you are choosing a daycare for your child is that you should drop in unannounced  
 and i would want to do that too you know make sure they do not have everything spick and span just because it is visiting time or whatever  
 i think that would be one of the best things you could do and and i do not know one thing with me is i just try to r- rely on my gut reaction  
 you know if if something is bothering me if i do not feel good about something then probably there is a good reason why  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 that is right  
 and hopefully there will be somebody to take care of us you know where we will not have to go into a home but my my dad says that what h- there is five of us kids and he says that he is gonna spend two months of the year with each of us  
 and whoever treated him the worse he is gonna spend the other two months of the year with them so they will have him for four months of the year it is like thanks dad you know  
  
 i do not know what would happen if if my parents needed to go live with somebody  
 yeah  
 uh-huh  
 yeah  
 yeah and my grandfather is kind of in that place now where he cannot do anything he cannot get around like he wants to  
 so i- he  
 e-  
 he is in his eighties  
 so but he has been sick for like over ten years  
 and it has gotten w- you know continually worse  
 and you know f- there have been several times although it is not my place to question but i there have been several times that i have questioned why is he still alive you know he is just so unhappy  
 because he cannot get around like he wants to but  
 obviously the-  
 no huh-uh he lives with my grandmother and she luckily knock on wood has been healthy up to this point  
 with you know just some minor stuff but yeah she is almost as old as he is and and  
 not far he is in his seventies i am trying to make the poor old man older than he is  
 but yeah he has he has had a tough time of it and and i do not know what would happen like if my grandmother did die i do not know what we would do with him  
 i- you know i do not know if my mother would would take him or you know in her- her home or or what but  
 she is lucky she has a brother that lives in town so you know he could help out  
 but  
 right  
 yeah  
 oh  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 right  
 no i sure do not i d- really never did get a chance to know my grandparents because they all died when i was real young  
 yeah my mother she passed and my father he is living but he is  
 seventy five  
 but he is so far he was able to take care of hisself he is remarried and  
 and he is doing real well  
 yeah it is a blessing  
 but i just just knowing him he would not go for anything like that no way  
 no  
 yeah  
 right  
 well that is true  
 hmm  
 umm  
 yeah it does because if you just think if your own family do not want to be bothered with you what about someone else course they getting paid of course  
 but this  
 they not taking good care of you exactly  
 right the-  
 right exactly  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 that is a good idea though to do that  
 i i think i would do the same thing  
 they\'v- i am sure there is a lot of cases where they have been mistreated for whatever reason you know  
 i guess people just get tired of of people but we all are gonna get old one day if we keep living  
 you know so  
 oh wow  
 oh wow  
 really  
 oh  
 well hopefully that would never happen you know they would never need to  
 because nowadays people are taking better care of themselves  
 and they able to manage on they own you know which is  
 is a plus because if it was me i f- if i ever got to to that shape or got to that age i just felt i would be a bother to people  
 right  
 how old is he  
 oh okay  
 really  
 um-hum  
 right  
 um-hum  
 is he in a home or  
 right  
 so  
  
 wow  
 right  
 um-hum  
 well something like that you do not think about it wit-  
 you like to exercise  
 yeah  
 uh-huh  
 oh wow  
 um-hum  
 that is true yeah tha- that is about what i try to do  
 i just go walking and i usually try to go for about an hour e- and i have tried doing it every day but i mean sometimes i do not even do it once during the week but you know most of the time i try to get out there  
 i have got a dog that kind of helps me out yeah  
 yeah  
 uh-huh that is about how old ours is  
 he keeps my pace up yeah yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 not a problem yeah i did aerobics in high school and we did it every day  
 you know monday through friday and you know when you started out the class it was awful but i mean i was in the best shape then now that i think back but my knees just cannot handle the pounding anymore that aerobics or running do  
 uh-huh  
 oh know and i have heard of like in swimming pools they teach aerobics  
 and it is supposed to be really good but i do not know i like something that is cheap and that is relaxing as well as good for you  
 yeah  
 yeah i really enjoy walking  
 it seems t- i do not know m- i am just my whole self i am happier if i go walking  
 um-hum and your worries  
 and your worries  
 um-hum  
 oh no  
 oh d-  
 oh yeah  
 i  
 i do not know i have never i have done a little bit of weight-lifting but i never i do not know i  
 if i do not enjoy it it does not i do not stick with it i am terrible that way and  
 i did not like the competitiveness of them but i enjoyed p- playing around with the sports that did not you know i enjoyed the sport itself i just  
 probably did not like the human factor in it  
 oh wow i have never tried that  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 yeah my husband enjoyed soccer  
 he liked that but i think he is the competitive type i would rather just stick with  
 walking and sometimes i like to go you know a neighbor friend of mine goes once in a while with me but some- a lot of times i like just to go by myself  
 whenever i mean you know i will just do it in the middle of the day  
 whenever i have got a minute i guess  
 you know or if i do not have a minute sometimes i just leave anyway  
 yeah  
 oh wow  
 oh  
 that is hard  
 generally i do i have not gotten very much lately i have been extremely busy you know are not we all  
 but when i used to do a lot of exercise what i would do is about three times a week i would go out either go running or walking for a pretty short distance like two miles to two and a half miles  
 and then if i had enough time or or alternately from walking i would do some weight-lifting  
 with free weights  
 and you know i have i wanted to keep it up but the the hard part is finding time to fit it into my day now  
 how about you  
 um-hum  
 oh ho that is good yeah i- if i go walking i should walk my dog with me  
 he needed the exercise he gets bored  
 you know he is a he is about a year-old puppy  
 but  
 yeah  
 as he drags you along i know yeah usually i en- i enjoy it  
 you know after a while like running when i used to run the first the first month was just torture you know i had to just drag myself through it but after that when i started being able to fall into a rhythm and keep a couple miles going  
 you know then it was a- a lot better  
 um-hum  
 oh  
 uh-huh  
 i know i- i know a couple of women at work who are are in low impact aerobic now and and then one other who said no i tried this you know high o- high impact then i went to low impact and then i could not do it at all  
 um-hum  
 uh-huh  
 yeah walking fits that i mean i figure when i go back to getting some aerobic exercise it will probably be walking instead of running  
 yeah well you lose yourself in the exercise for a while and that is you know it gets your mind  
 i am sorry  
 yeah it gets your mind off everything  
 you know i  
 you know i i want to go back to weight-lifting just because i felt  
 felt better and looked better when i did that and i have got a neighbor who he does it and i have tried to get in with him and several weeks ago i i d- weight-lifting the first time in about two years and of course i injured my back  
 so i have not been able to do it for weeks and  
 it is the you know i am going to i know i will start again probably sundays and wednesdays  
 but you know that is as much as i can handle right now  
 and i hope i could do that  
 yeah  
 well everyone is that way i i you know was encouraged a lot when i was younger to do sports and i just hated every one of them  
 so  
 um-hum  
 that may that may be me too i the only one i ever really enjoyed was frisbee golf  
 you know that is you know and and i got to be pretty good with a roommate of mine in college he was competitive but he toned it down when we were going out and playing and so it was more of a challenge to myself you know a golfer is mainly trying to get your score down  
 and so it was pretty neat and that i enjoyed  
 but other than that most sports i have not enjoyed maybe a little soccer once in a while  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 well my wife likes to go walking she likes me to go with her but and our schedules are not always together she she consults and she is caring for her  
 parents  
 and then i work you know a good nine hours a day ten ten hours if you consider commuting and stuff so  
 yeah it it  
 so what did you buy  
 um-hum  
 okay  
 actually we were looking at the saturn s l two  
 and we are not buying quite yet but but it seems interesting  
 at least why did you decide to go with the civic  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 sure  
 which features were were besides we- is this the passenger side airbag you mean or  
 um-hum  
 right  
 well we are opening a one car that we were thinking of getting this point it is mostly because we are going to move and are thinking of selling the car we have  
 which is not worth all that much and and buying a new one  
 and if we did that  
 we have several times rented something like a chevy corsica  
 and thought about buying a an eighty nine corsica or something because we could about afford that based on what  
 without having to pay more that what we could sell our current car for  
  
 mainly we are not real fussy people and anyway we want some s- basic features like air conditioning and and and space you know headroom is is somewhat important  
 and  
 other than that  
 we are we are looking primarily at price and potential reliability  
 and that is one thing that was impressive about the saturn is that  
 if there are problems they have s- they have been very good about fixing them  
  
 yeah  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 did the issue of american versus non-american ever enter into your decision or  
 um-hum  
 um-hum  
 open for debate yeah  
 and yeah i- i am sort of in the same positioning it would be nice we would now have a nissan  
 and  
 i sort of feel l- that while buying an american e- car whatever that means these days may not have much of an impact on the economy  
 sending a signal t- t- to saturn that that there are people who who think that what they are doing is the right thing  
 might be useful on a on a somewhat smaller scale it would not overcome a couple of thousand dollars worth of difference in price for the same features though  
 consumer reports  
 yeah we saw that and and they were very highly thought of and what surprised me is that the car was peppier than  
 the competition  
 uh-huh  
 but  
 um-hum  
 yeah  
 well it seems like the same is true right now for the for the saturn also though  
 that yo- you know if you want to get  
 power door locks you also have to go with windows and mirrors and air conditioning  
 i bought a ninety two honda civic i was looking more for a smaller type car  
 so it was between the the honda civic and the saturns  
 really  
 um-hum  
 th- the only thing i did not like about the saturn it was kind of like the civic had stuff the saturn did not have like the airbag  
 and just generally more features for for the money  
 i thought the saturn was a good car except that it n- there was it is just not possible to get some of the features  
 but  
 right the airbag we- i guess you could al- you could also buy things like electric locks and things like that  
 yeah i guess you cou- if you wanted to pay for the extra ones then sure you know you could always stick them on but the cost would have been greater  
 for the saturn and th- the track record for the saturn was unproven  
 what other cars are you considering  
 um-hum  
 oh  
 uh-huh  
 oh yeah  
 um-hum  
 oh yeah yeah  
 i- i subscribe to the the mailing list the saturn mailing list on you know on the internet  
 and both looked at that and also with the honda mailing list  
 and got some  
 you know actual  
 real world world experiences from people  
 who had actually had these machines and these cars and  
 had you know had personal experience with them  
 and  
 i d- kind of decided to go with the civic because  
 there it had like a proven track record and  
 yes oh we- i had wanted to buy domestic well i had a slight preference for buying domestic even though i do not  
 it is not a personal  
 preference but just from the way my family  
 has has bought in the past and  
 i- i am not sure exactly how much of an impact buying an american car has  
 on the economy but but that was  
 yeah a slight issue  
 um-hum  
 um-hum but saturn was  
 i think they they just got reviewed in the like  
 last consumer reports right  
 and  
 um-hum  
 yeah they have relatively powerful engines usually  
 when i think of power for cars in that range it is usually nissan  
 because they if you look at their specs for horsepower they always  
 really have ove- a lot of horsepower  
 and and the civic well the  
 the only bad thing about japanese cars in general is  
 buying options  
 as clusters of options you know y- in order to get like a sunroof you have to go to the the e x the highest model  
 oh  
 oh great yeah i use- i used to camp  
 pardon  
 that is about the same here used to go off with my parents  
 was yeah many years ago or like when i was seven and eight i am over i am over twenty one now it does not count any more but  
 but used to go out you know with seven eight ten that range  
 we had one of these little fold-out campers with the hard roof that you had to like crank up  
 pain in the butt to put up  
 well it was convenient but it it took you like two hours to put it up it was like the worst designed hardtop camper ever  
 you had you had to crank the top up with this big crank then you had to like pull the ends out and brace them up and put in these hard side panels and you had to fit them in just right and lock them into place and then when you got the whole thing together you had to lower the roof down like six inches to lock everything in and  
 it usually failed  
 i will be have to be somebody have to be  
 i do not cheat  
 oh oh that is cheating though  
 that is just like a week away  
 i imagine  
 oh we used t- we used to like camping though it was nice just to get away from the house you know  
 there is a little lake called sand lake just off in the middle of the forest somewhere and they decided to put a national campground up there so  
 the type of the it is  
 about an hour and a half  
 yes  
 oh well traverse city is getting quite big  
 yeah they are building all sorts of new malls and airports and  
 just boomp  
 oh boy you guys been all over  
 you guys been all over  
 jeez  
 jeez  
 well at least it keeps things interesting  
 you could camp out at all the different camp park- grounds all over the place  
 see i do not know much about texas  
 um jeez  
 can find your own private lake almost  
 oh jeez  
 yeah  
 yeah i have been in those crampgrounds before each each area is like five feet wide you know and you  
 yep  
 yeah yeah that is it like a communal campground almost  
 i am all the way up i am like almost right on the border to canada you know in houghton  
 it is still a bit cold up here yeah i would not it would not be it is not you would not freeze to death but you would need lots of blankets to keep warm the way it is right now  
 holy cow  
 that is a lot warmer than it is here it is probably probably about sixty up here  
 oh crap  
 oh yipes  
 jeez  
 once every few years they get around to sending one u- one up here but that is about it  
 oh cripe  
 do they have like state campgrounds and stuff down there  
 oh that is cheating though  
 well  
 i li- i would i like the campgrounds more where they do not have really any electrical or anything but they do have like the the modern toilets  
 yeah we- not even for a shower we didn- we did not care about showers you go down to the lake and swim and that is good enough you know we usually did not go for more than you know three four days at a time so  
 that it  
 use- used to more than i do now  
 used to camp more than i do now  
 you do  
 oh yeah  
 right  
 oh uh-huh yeah yeah but pretty convenient better than sleeping on the ground  
 oh really  
 i guess they are a lot easier now than they used to be  
 well i don- i do not camp near as much as we used to we used to go to the lake all the time we use- we all ski and everything we used to all go to the lake all the time and my parents had a cabin at the lake but we do not go much any more and  
 if we go we like check into a lo- to a to a hotel but  
 i know but it is much more comfortable  
 now where do you go where do you go to the lake up there t- lake michigan  
 really  
 really how far are you from traverse city  
 i am my husband used to do a lot of work up there in that area in traverse city he loved it there  
 so it is  
 yeah it is it is a- well in just in the last four years it has really gotten  
 four or five years i guess since we have been up there and the last time we were up there it was really really big and and getting busy busy  
 yeah yeah a- we were down in indianapolis for a while  
 you know and we did not do much camping down there though  
 yeah yeah my husband has be- he- he has been in miami and now he is in hou- i am here in dallas getting ready to go down to houston and he is in houston right now  
 so yeah yeah we mo- move around periodically about every two years seems like  
 yeah yeah  
 oh really yeah there are the- there is a lot of places to camp bu- there is a lot of lakes here in texas you know a lot of lot of lakes here in texas  
 yeah you do not well the- the lakes here  
 a lot of places like we- we lived in oklahoma for a while we- that is where i we are from actually oklahoma and if you went to a lake it was busy i mean so busy you know you could not hardly ski because the water would be all chopped up because there was so many boats on the water and s- ju- but here  
 nobody uses the lakes  
 you know i do not know why if there is just so many lakes it- then- you know that there is  
 the people are spread out or what but there is just hardly anybody at the lake when you go to the lake so it is just nice and  
 you know you have a lot of room you are not real crowded and  
 yeah yeah really yeah you can go out and ski and stuff or you can camp and there is not necessarily someone just right  
 you know next to you you know so close that you cannot talk without them hearing your every word  
 yeah yeah  
 yeah yeah you see that little area in there well by the time you leave you know you know everybody that is camped around you cecause you are all living right there together practically  
 yeah  
 right right but anyway it is pretty nice down here it is nice enough to camp out down here is it that warm up there  
 yeah so it is pretty cold  
 really well it is really nice here you probably would u- just have to have  
 i mean you could sleep in a sleeping bag and probably not even keep it zipped you know at night it is  
 it is nice well it was like eighty eight today  
 you know so it is  
 there is a yeah it is pro- in fact right now it is probably about seventy five outside right now  
 you know it is ni- it is real nice and warm although i do not know what is so nice about it we are having a tornado we are under a tornado warning right now  
 and yeah they have they have been coming on  
 d- you guys do not have tornados up there do you  
 yeah  
 yeah we have so many here y- i mean there is just like all the time so i- but we are under a tornado watch right now that is all  
 they do yeah they do they have  
 a- and they usually have like all kinds of you know facilities like electrical  
 you know and  
 and all that kind of stuff yeah but  
 yeah if you have kids and stuff it sure makes it a lot more convenient  
 toilets and showers  
 not even showers  
 yeah  
 yeah oh w- we used to go for c- yeah like it wo-  
 to public s-  
 a year a year or two in public service i do not know that tha- that seems like a lot  
 i mean yeah i think you know it would be nice especially like you know when people are kids are going to college they should do some public service  
  
 true  
 yeah i am twenty six  
 that is true yeah so- so- some people spend far too much time  
 do- doing the same thing and not and not really you know seeing any other part of the world  
 oh yeah  
 oh i know  
 well it certainly would but  
 i- i just  
 yeah  
 uh- uh-  
 no i have not  
 i ju- i just survived los angeles but i was just down there last week so  
 no that is that is okay i was  
 i- i- it was  
 oh yeah yeah you know i heard gunfire it was a it was the first time i felt my wife was you know you know a little bit threatened  
 so  
 yeah i know  
 well they have they never they never interfere they just  
 i know  
 it- it is  
  
 i mean it seems like being you know b- basity basic decency would you know require them to do it but  
 done that  
 right  
 i do not know i i think it- a lot of it is just you know see how other people live i mean you know i i tend to be you know in in my own circles of friends and  
 we are all pretty much the same  
 probably no hopefully in california so wh- i- it is not really upper middle class here is the problem  
  
 but what about the people who do not make it i mean what do you what do you do with them  
 right  
 right  
 oh sure i am sure there is there is plenty to do  
 yeah i  
 i c- i can relate to that  
 i- i do think you know people people need to to meet other types of people  
 well by just ju you know you know living living in different ways than they do  
 no not not at all  
 right  
  
  
 part of i- part of it though  
 i mean i agree with you sometimes it sounds like a lot but i think less than a year  
 they do not learn enough  
 i think you just about have to be away from home for a full year  
 under less than ideal conditions to learn some of the a- u- you know lessons that really need to be learned  
 may i may i ask how old you are  
 twenty six you are young enough so you might have been affected right so yeah i really i really feel that if every kid had to be away from home  
 boy when they got back they certainly would have a different perspective  
 yeah i mean the  
 yeah  
 and you know mom and dad and home look a lot better  
 if you have you have been away and i do not mean even in a foreign country  
 you know i mean if you were just away from home for a year  
 wi- without the comforts that that mom and dad provide if i mean if you are lucky enough to have both but  
 but yeah i th- i think it would be wonderful  
 and i think it would broaden the the horizons  
 of the kids for really  
 the way the rest of the world the rest of the country lives  
 it is a it is a matter of getting a feeling for humanity itself i think  
 have you been in the service at all  
 oh listen i- that that is not even funny i do not know why i laughed please forgive me it has t-  
 it has to have been awful  
 it is i am so distressed with the media  
 that the the people in the helicopter that did not land and save that guy from being killed  
 i mean  
 well i mean this is not like we are fighting a war someplace else  
 this is this is the bad guys were killing us well i am sorry if you know i just cannot believe that they did not go down there and stop that from happening  
 i i would think so but are are you married  
 so you do not have anybody yet that you have to feel that you have to protect  
 but  
 well let us think on this for a moment if if you had been required sometime  
 around the age of twenty to spend a year someplace doing something  
 what what sort of things might you feel would be  
 the type of things that would do good for the country  
 upper middle class probably  
 or are you higher than that  
 yeah that is true  
 do you feel that  
 well i- i personally feel that six weeks of basic training ought to be the- a mandatory part of this year  
 you have any feelings about that  
 well you okay you make it as rigorous as you can  
 for everybody you know and if they just cannot make it it is like other things you you lessen it so that they can make it  
 you try to demand that much of them but if they cannot make it and and there are people you know who are who are not  
 who are not as healthy and so on and so forth  
 but they can find other things for them to do also  
 i mean it is it is like in high school or or junior high or wherever that certain people are are  
 excused from going to gym class or whatever  
 but in the main almost everybody has to do it  
 but  
 and yeah and college does not really do it  
 yeah first of all not everybody gets a chance to go to college  
 but in college i mean you are still  
 among basically the same class of people that you have grown up with  
 so you do not get to see how the other half lives or the other two thirds or however many there are now  
  
 i i am old enough i am over fifty  
 a-  
 oh yeah  
 well i am going to have mine in two more classes  
 no i am not well then i have to take my exams my orals but  
 that is kind of what i would like to do  
 i might even want to go on and get my p h d  
 it is just that  
 i do not know it is so comfortable where i am and and if i  
 leaky listen i flew in a four seater plane  
 i went to the lake of the ozarks tw- on fourth of july weekend  
 i met this guy he is a total yahoo but let me tell you  
 i there was something about him he is in his forties  
 but there was something about him i was attracted to him not necessarily for  
 n-  
 he is a listen to me he is a  
 he is a police officer  
 and he he has he has never been married that i know what you mean oh gross i like men in uniform  
 but this guy he i do not know i al- i found myself just being drawn toward him i go sit by him  
 on the at the during this weekend he was there with us  
 he was my friend\'s friend no this is at the lake of the ozarks  
 on fourth of july weekend  
 and i just really  
 i do not know and then i find out my cousin calls and tells me he really likes you  
 we are going to fly listen we are going to fly over saint louis  
 he was going to take me for a ride in his plane  
 no it is not that kind of a plane it is a small four seater  
 what happened to the one you were going out with  
 yeah  
 oh well that put a stop to that one  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 oh my goodness  
 but they are friends are not they is not that how you met randy  
 oh you mean you just met randy casually  
 oh my gosh  
 oh my god that is totally ironic  
 oh my  
 that is totally wild  
 i am sorry but it is just too darn funny that you are telling me to quit that jungle fever and then you go head over heals into it  
 oh yeah  
 yeah i remember  
 yeah i remember that  
 yeah  
 mhm  
 they do not know who the heck you are  
 that is right we are we are furthering higher  
 level planes whatever  
 well you know what i really like taking classes and everything  
 but sometimes like i just had to do this summary of this one you know these scholarly journals and stuff  
 they  
 they they talk so high and mighty and stuff  
 and you have to decipher what the heck they are saying to understand what the whole concept  
 is for a while and that kind of bugs me i just like reading the books and  
 discussing it and that is that  
 i know well  
 oh i i have one at work  
 i mean i use the one at work now i us- it used to take me hours to write things leaky now  
 i mean i guess because one i have been practicing more  
 and using it more i mean constantly i am writing and two because of the computer also i can whip things up so quickly  
 that you cannot even believe it  
 yeah  
 oh my god if i can leaky anybody can  
 everybody has a master is out here  
 well it seems like it  
 you are kidding  
 oh  
 rachel do you know you can teach at a junior college then and get tenure and all  
 heck yeah  
 come out here to california  
 come out here in c- california  
 that is the danger zone  
 that is so dangerous that comfort zone will get you all the time  
 oh  
 yeah  
 oh  
 oh it was his plane damn it  
 do not trick yourself  
 it was his plane that is why you were attracted to him  
 oh gross  
 oh sick  
 where did you meet him  
 what wee- oh in new orleans  
 oh  
 uh-huh  
 oh no  
 i just do not know why i am attracted to him it could be his cessna that we were in  
 oh my well see  
 so i have no men  
 randy  
 he went moved to texas  
 and then he  
 i know and then he is coming back in september but going  
 to u c l a to start his masters  
 and then and and check this out okay he appli- he is doing his masters in public health  
 twelve black people got accepted to the school of public health in september of ninety five at u c l a  
 two of them were black men  
 out of the twelve black people two were black men  
 and those two black men are  
 duntduduntan  
 geoffrey and randy  
 can you ima- rachel is that like a  
 needle in a haystack  
 u c l a i meet two black guys in my jungle fever mode  
 and they are both in the same masters department  
 september ninety five  
 no  
 no i met ran-  
 i met randy on my own  
 i met him february twenty fourth on my birthday went to bombay\'s and partied and i saw this black guy  
 and we started talking and that is it  
 and they work in the same field  
 with mentally disabled people  
 is that weird or what  
 except randy is nicer than geoffrey  
 because i am just getting out of it i just talked to geoffrey night before last and we are friends nothing more nothing less  
 because remember i gave him the boot  
 well first he wrote me the letter and then we got back together  
 and then he started to become real intimate with me and i got scared and i cut him off  
 and i had not talked to him for two and half months  
 and so now we are  
 god if they record this message  
 all is we are talking about are dudes  
 give me a break  
 well it is in mashed with education at the same time  
 anyways  
 so can you  
 yeah  
 hey i want to go i want to do my masters  
 oh i hate writing about shit too th- but that is the wor- i mean that is the whole gist of a masters is you write your way through  
 through the courses right  
 i cannot believe you have done this without a personal computer  
 oh  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 that is cool that is cool to know though  
 you think that i could si-  
 superar my writing abilities too  
 i am so insecure about my writing abil- abilities  
 wow  
 were your parents down there on the fourth  
 wow  
 did they stay with you for the whole two weeks  
 oh i thought they were staying over some other relatives  
 yeah my mom got the story wrong  
 uh-huh  
 they must have been pretty excited with the little guy  
 did you guys get a chance to go out and use them as babysitters  
  
 oh  
  
 yeah  
 so how long till he starts crawling  
 oh wow  
 hey  
 what was it june sixteenth right  
 man he is progressing  
 well that is good to hear  
 oh  
 i did not know the year we were up here i did not know that they had bands playing constantly at the main  
 old main  
 oh different stuff all all different stuff it is just like all day there is bands and stuff there  
  
 it seems like there is more  
 more of those little  
 booths because now they stretch like  
 they go up allen  
 and then they they curve around like a horseshoe and go back down by that post office  
 and then they a- they have stuff that goes all the way from the the the road that the panther is on  
 the lion whatever  
 the the road the lion is on it goes from the bottom of that  
 all the way up and around you know willard and then on to the mall  
 has it b- always been that many  
 i do not remember it being all the way on pollack like that  
 before  
 but  
 aw i do not remember it  
 i do not remember looking at that many things when i when i was up there  
 but  
 yeah so it is kind of it is kind of nice i mean it is really crowded here in town now  
 because everybody it seems like everybody is out but  
 nobody i really know is up like  
 oh sure  
 you can go another decade without seeing them  
  
 uh-huh  
 nah oh i am getting a car  
 yeah  
 the lebaron  
 i think  
 oh you heard about that  
 jeez i did not even know that p- you probably knew before i did  
 oh  
 i wish they i wish somebody would have because my dad like told me like the weekend that i could have gone home with boger and gotten it  
 because he is not going home like i have not  
 he told me last saturday  
 and dave left you know friday to go home  
 so then i called dave up this weekend i am like dave when are you going home again he is like well he is not going home this weekend for arts fest  
 and he is not going home next weekend  
 and so it is like you know i go- i- if i get a car it can be like by like the thirtieth of july or something  
 well i would not want to put that much extra miles on my car  
 thing has got like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and sixty or something as it is  
 yeah  
 i think so  
  
 but  
 so i am g- i am going to i am going to ask and see if diane  
 wants to come  
 home for the weekend  
 with maybe because  
 our friend well her her future roommate too lynn  
 is g- lives like by me  
 i i will just ask because also she diane  
 diane is in miami now  
 and she  
 yeah she grew up around miami then she moved to canada  
 and  
 e- yeah so now she is like living in state college  
 so it is kind of like  
 i do not know if she has been to philadelphia  
 or like actually been around there so i am like if if she wants to go home i could say like well we could go hang out around philadelphia we can hang out with lynn and  
 and her boyfriend and stuff like that and then we can just come home after the next day and i can get my car  
 so  
 my other option is jason his parents came up for this weekend  
 but they are not going home until like monday or tuesday or something and  
 what  
 his parents both met at penn state  
 and they married and all that so they are they are and then  
 his brother went to penn state  
 so they are like they c- they they ca- when dave told me when he was little they came up to penn state every home football game  
 and stayed the whole weekend  
 and his parents come up i think for every his dad still comes up just for the football games now  
 grand finale and all  
 and slept through it did not flinch  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 they were down here for close to two weeks  
 yeah  
 no  
 nah at mo- nah they went away for like  
 two days  
 to tampa to my aunt and uncle\'s house  
 but other than that they were here  
 yeah  
 yeah they thought he was pretty cool  
 no not really because dina is breastfeeding  
 so  
 we could not do that  
 we are  
 at the mercy of his feeding schedule  
 so not much we could do really right now  
 till he is  
 on a bottle  
 couple months  
 he will be a month old on  
 sunday  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 no  
 yes he is  
 tell me what has been going on at state college  
 i am still jealous i want to be at arts fest  
 what kind of bands  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 the r- the panther  
 what the hell are you talking about john  
 panther  
 my god  
 yeah  
 i think  
 i think so  
 i do not know  
 yeah yeah it went all the way down  
 pollack road  
 yeah it was  
 big  
 couple of years ago  
 yeah  
 oh man probably like  
 yeah but probably a lot of people i know are there  
 probably all my fraternity brothers are up there  
 that like that i have not seen for two years  
  
 but hey when we  
 when we come up  
 for  
 thanksgiving the week before thanksgiving  
 probably what we will do  
 do you know what your plans are like well you i guess you do not know really  
 you are  
 what  
 oh yeah i knew about that  
 oh yeah long before  
 i was not allowed to tell you  
 why did not he tell you then  
 yeah  
 oh  
 yeah  
 your dad should come up and pick you up  
 and bring you home and then you can drive the car back  
 that is fine  
 a hundred and  
 sixty thousand miles  
 really  
 wow  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 mhm  
 miami  
 yeah  
 that is quite a difference

 yeah we played softball last night we were clobbered  
 yeah  
 not playing soccer this summer that will start up again in the fall  
 that is okay  
 yeah indoor indoor ended about four weeks ago and we did not want to play anymore  
 it and it was getting  
 too hot the  
 it w- there is like this heat wave going through and there is heat warnings and the heat index is up in the hundred and twenties and  
 they radio keeps saying keep your grandparents and your dogs inside  
 be sure to drink lots of water  
 yeah so we are making it  
 so i am going to go to the library and study in an air conditioned home for  
 air conditioning in the building  
 i study both today i will study on my own  
 yeah  
 yeah but i like  
 i like mooching every  
 yeah i like  
 mooching everything i can out of their brains so  
 i just spoke to susan yesterday  
 yesterday two days ago i had not spoken to her like in a f- few months  
 probably since the last time i spoke to you  
 and  
 she called out of the blue looking for doug\'s telephone number lisa is  
 going on vacation out to san francisco with her dad  
 so she is going to look doug up lisa is going to go to college next year rhode island  
 yeah  
 can you believe that  
 and they got engaged  
 ye- yes officially he gave her a ring and everything they do not know when or  
 they do not know when or how they are going to get married but they are engaged  
 well she got a ring  
 yeah  
 yeah she is  
 i do not think they have decided yet  
 but she is still in hickory yeah  
 probably is  
 but now that lisa is going to go away to school  
 yeah  
 no i asked her that too  
 she i think she is still working like contract here and there but right now she is not working  
 yeah actually she was offered a job in charlotte she was contracting for this bank and then they offered her a job  
 full time  
 but they offered they said she said  
 they offered her a job at such little pay she could not really justify you know she was making more working as a contractor  
 here and there  
 than they were offering her full time and  
 she said they offered the men more than w- they were offering the women  
 there were a lot of people that worked the contract they offered jobs to and they all discussed  
 you know what was going on and the men were all offered a lot more than the women  
 so  
 a school and i do not know the name of the school but it was in it is in  
 oh god it is that town on on the coast in south carolina  
 oh why cannot i think of  
 savannah no not savannah  
 what mark  
 charleston charleston  
 no charleston  
 yeah talk about a swank location too  
 yeah he was but he he is just finishing up so you remind me of him like oh i do not know  
 have some  
 oh yeah oh yeah so and he is he did fine i mean it was really hard and you would talk to him and he is like oh boy you know i am just exhausted  
 but he is really thrilled now so  
 it will work out if if that is what you really want  
 well that is all you need then  
 you know really  
 boy you are put put yourself through the paces though engineering school and then medical school  
 sucker for an abuse  
 yeah  
 oh my you still doing softball or anything like that  
 were you  
 you doing the soccer are you still doing soccer  
 no  
 oh okay yeah well i  
 see you had mentioned you were doing the indoor i think it was the indoor soccer or something  
 get just get  
 yeah  
 aw jeez  
 oh no  
 do not forget to water your grandparents and your dogs  
 how funny  
 oh my god  
 oh yeah well do you have  
 do you have people you study with or are you just pretty much on your own  
 yeah  
 yeah sometimes though you get a lot more done that way  
 or it is  
 you can get distracted otherwise  
 yeah that does help  
 well do you hear from susan or anybody  
 oh my gosh y-  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 oh really  
 scares me  
 boy  
 i i am sure i would not even recognize the little spud anymore  
 did they officially  
 so but what  
 so so what is new  
 yeah that is i guess that is progress oh it only took how many years to get to that point though  
 poor susan it is just so funny those two you know  
 now she is she still in hickory or what has she decided to do about the house  
 that is probably the big stumbling  
  
 yeah  
 i bet that will change her mind because that house will seem so quiet  
 that she working at all  
 oh really  
 yeah  
 yeah because the last time i heard to from her was at christmas she wrote me a note and  
 she was having she had said she was doing that contracting business and not not found anything but i mean it must be hard to find anything really in hickory anyway  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 aw  
 oh that  
 ooh i would have been so offended  
 clint dewitt is engaged  
 wedding date is still up in the air  
 but most likely next summer after clint graduates  
 they closed on their house a couple of weeks ago so things are coming together for them  
 they plan what  
 mhm her name is kris with a k  
 they plan to get married in topeka since most of their friends are there  
 i suppose  
 but is not that interesting  
 and she says she has started walking every morning before she goes to work  
 and has not lost an ounce  
 has not  
 no it has not  
 made an ounce of difference  
 and so she says as soon as she is all through at pizza hut she is going to start jazzercise again  
 just depending classes  
 oh no  
 uh-huh  
 oh no  
 bulimia and anorexia nervos-  
  
 a bid for attention  
 i i think this is normal  
 oh  
 yeah  
 and try things on  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 fat ones  
 yeah  
 i get to thinking my very best friends were always short  
 and i do not know if it is because i was short myself taller people intimidated me  
 yeah  
 something like that  
 yeah  
 mhm  
 yeah  
 oh  
 okay  
 uh-huh  
 mhm clint and  
 clint and his girlfriend  
 okay  
 school friends  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 and lost an ounce  
 oh i was going to say how could you tell if you have lost an ounce  
 i see  
 good i  
 uh-huh  
 you know today the doctor told rochelle had to go to the doctor today and the doctor told her that she was overweight  
 and we have had some problems with rochelle in the past and i always try to be really gentle in what i say to her about her weight  
 because she has had some  
 inappropriate eating behavior  
 like the making herself throw up stuff  
 and the  
 yeah yeah she has  
 had some strange stuff also she went through a period where she was saying she was throwing up all the time and she was not  
 or at least if she was there was was no evidence of it  
 yeah yeah that was it was very strange  
 that was back a number of years ago anyway i try to be real gentle in what i say because  
 jody is real nasty  
 he just is rude  
 and he is  
 all brothers i guess are rude but he is more rude i think then  
 than it seems necessary to me  
 he rides her hard all the time about everything  
 yeah and i thought the doctor was  
 maybe a little more abrupt than he needed to be it was not our regular doctor  
 so i am working with her attitude on it and she has gone through some real depression  
 about weight because  
 she tends to have friends who are built like jackie and jenny  
 and y-  
 you know one of the things ma  
 she will not go to the mall what teenage girls like to do is go to the mall with their friends  
 because they want to go in to these teeny tiny shops the three five and seven or five  
 yes and then they want her to try things on and things do not fit  
 and she feels like they were deliberately humiliating her  
 because she feels so humiliated and surely they must of known this would be humiliating well i am sure they are completely clueless  
 understand how terrible it feels ju-  
 but i also  
 and she wears about a size fourteen  
 and she is just  
 having such a rough time with that jenny told her she needed new friends  
 well normal size  
 i am she has friends that look like eight year olds  
 when i see her with her friends they do not look like they are all the same age  
 and she just needs some more normal sized friends  
 i do not know well you know my very best friend  
 lin- linda i think got to be five ten or five ten and a half something like that  
 and in high school her nickname was legs  
 however as an adult i find myself  
 in some ways feeling a sort of bond when i am around short women  
 in oh yeah this feels real comfortable here are other people who understand what it is like when your feet do not reach the floor  
 why you want to carry along a briefcase  
 when you are going to be sitting in a conference room for a long time  
 do you have your door in by now  
 how cool  
  
  
 oh that is neat  
 well take a picture of your new door too from the outside and the inside i would like to see that  
 i am sure  
 does it have a stoop then outside  
 just a stone  
 see in in these  
 parts you have to have a three foot stoop  
  
 mhm  
 in muck  
 right  
 how neat  
 it sounds really nice  
 yeah  
 well i have just been working but i am planning my next vacation which is i am going in september to japan  
 how about that  
 well no actually i am going into debt to do it but  
 i decided you know i have been telling my students because rachel lived here two years ago and  
 she was the one that really said come and stay with me  
 and then this other girl that i had as as a student ten years ago  
 still keeps in touch and she called me and said when are you coming and i thought if i do not go they are going to stop asking me  
 and that way you know and this way at least it you know i can go and have a place to stay part of the time anyway  
 but i am going on a courier flight too you know where  
 you carry somebody else\'s luggage or something else for somebody  
 well maybe  
 really well it is really like being a spy you should see these instructions i have you know it say\'s like you have to get to the airport and  
 look for a guy in a blue jacket with a certain kind of s- insignia on it and he will give you  
 papers and take you to the luggage place and check you in and then the luggage will go and then you have one carry on piece  
 that you get to take and then  
 and then when you get to japan you have to  
 deliver the papers to a guy that is in a certain location in the immigration area and then  
 he will take the luggage  
 i think you are carrying probably i am carrying boxes of stuff or i might be carrying suitcases i do not know  
 well i do not know maybe documents or industrial stuff i have no idea  
 but it is all it is i mean it is all legal they guarantee it is legal and there is a guy there that gives you the papers and takes the papers so it is not like  
 you go through and the customs people say  
 well and the and the papers say what is in the stuff you know  
 but there is a guy there that to explain it so supposedly it has got to be legal stuff  
 and then when you come back you call you call a man named mister noriko and you  
 tell him that you are back in town and he will tell you where to meet him and then  
 you go to the airport and you meet a guy who may or may not give you things to bring back because that is  
 that is not sure but he gives you back your tickets see when you get to japan they take your return ticket  
 and you cannot have it back until you come back and so then you get back then there is a guy at this end that meets you  
 and then as soon as he  
 takes you i know but buffy it is it is like a third of the cost of the round trip ticket to japan in fact  
 it it was four hundred dollars round trip right to japan so and it is like  
 yeah  
 it is it is twelve hundred from here but it is i am paying four  
 i am paying four hundred yeah  
 yeah but but the it it is  
 right and it is  
 well and i am going to get a train pass like you know they have in europe but they have one in japan because  
 flying is real expensive and i want to go all these places and  
 though everybody says well you should fly there because you do not have very much time but one flight in ja-  
 right a bullet train  
 one one flight in japan like i wanted to go hokkaido that is where sapporo is you know in the very north north part  
 and a round trip flight from tokyo costs more than my round trip flight to japan  
 oh god yes i have got my door in my front yard and watson comes in and out and runs up and down the stairs and races outside again and  
 today he had a visiting dog that came over to put nice pretty dog a a one of those blue tick you know  
 liver spotted type dog  
 big dog ran kind of got left home and was wandering the streets and so we took him in and called his owner and  
 watched and played with him for a long time and had a really good time so  
 and i almost felt  
 i felt bad when i sent him back home because they said well he could st- he is tied up all the time and i thought  
 oh that poor dog i wish i had not called you  
 well it is a beautiful door it  
 so  
 no it has a stone  
 yeah i went and  
 i we-  
 well not for this you do not because it is it is you do not have to have anything you could  
 just step outside but it is i went and got a  
 i picked i went to a stone quarry and picked out a stone  
 and had this great big stone delivered and then they also delivered  
 two stones that they put down in the river so i can go down and stand  
 y- it is really nice having a little a couple little because it used to be i would go down and i would  
 be in muck and then  
 dead now i  
 go and i stand on my beautiful stones  
 yeah it is nice  
 so what have you been doing  
 wow  
 oh a rich girl  
 oh  
 drugs  
 do not carry anything illegal and if you are going to do not discuss it now on the taped conversation  
 what kind of things are you carrying  
 well i mean well what kind of things will be in them  
 this is very bizarre  
 four hundred dollars  
 jesus it must be about seventeen hundred from here  
 oh i was going to say  
 oh that is very cheap  
 and then if you have a place to stay  
 now of course i understand it costs about eight hundred dollars a day to just walk around but  
 so you are going to get on one of those trains where they shove you in  
 they push you in behind and behind and pack you in  
 mhm  
 right  
 mhm  
  
 mhm  
 right  
 mhm  
 an interesting observation  
  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 uh-huh  
 right  
 oh  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 yeah  
 oh  
 yes  
 yeah  
  
 yeah  
 mhm  
 yeah  
  
 right  
 yeah  
 and well now will you check out the thermostat first  
 mhm and so preferably that will be all it all it needs  
 alright did i bring my torsion wrench up to you  
 okay  
 oh  
 oh  
 mhm  
 maybe you can trade off for it then  
 trade  
 trade the one i brought up into the dial one  
 yeah and  
 yeah  
 mhm  
 so  
 mhm  
 right  
 and i looked it up to see if that was a job i felt like doing and  
 it will be the biggest job i have ever done on a car but i think i will go ahead and give it a try  
 and  
 but the bottom line is you may remember my mentioning some while back that i was preaching in alaska back in january  
 and making a long story short through the course of that service  
 i began to feel like i needed to be engaged in outrage among some of the arabic people  
 here in the detroit area  
 and have not know how to start and have been praying for contacts with arabic people  
 well through looking for this car i have got it  
 what had ended up happening is i went over to get the vin number sunday night so i could get my insurance  
 by  
 phone you know on on monday morning and then go over and get  
 the car and bring it home  
 and while we were talking i said what country are you from and he said lebanon  
 and so i said to him  
 i said people like you are what make america great the immigrant  
 and know  
 he said he said that in eighteen years of living here no one had ever said that to him  
 that all he had heard was you guys come over here you take all our money  
 he says yeah he says we take money he says we take them from the jobs where we are working  
 he says just like anyone else who works  
 so there has been a lot of hostility in detroit toward the arabic peop-  
 and oh so in any case through that remark what happened is when i went over there on monday  
 he said he was very embarrassed he did not have the title  
 and what has happened is he has been running a collision shop so about a month ago he had gone over to an auction to buy a car for his wife  
 and he had bought this volvo  
 and then it had a mechanical problem and he did not even want to try to mess with it  
 it one mechanic said it was the head gasket one said it is the thermostat  
 and he said if it is just the thermostat then i am getting a car that needs almost no work  
 for twenty five hundred but the bottom line is he is selling it to me basically for what he has got in it  
 and it is just something he does not want to work on the car  
 and  
 so so that was what happened but meanwhile the title is tied up in lansing  
 because it was a theft recovery  
 so the insurance company had auctioned it you know and he has been driving it for a month  
 but you know to register it is one thing but to have the title in your hand is another  
 so he said that it it could be as much as two more weeks before he gets it  
 or it could arrive in the mail today  
 but meanwhile he was so embarrassed about that whole thing he had me in i had coffee with him  
 i asked him where to buy pine nuts we had been to a few of the arabic restaurants here in town and debbie has taken a liking to pine nut  
 so his wife ended up giving us a big bag of pine nut  
 and  
 you know plus you know we know where to get them now  
 plus they want to get together and all have dinner together  
 and he seems to be a muslim though he was talking more like a hindu  
 he said all roads lead to the same god  
  
 classic hinduism  
 so in any case  
 it has it has turned out to be not just one but two answers to prayer  
 you know with a bit of a delay thrown in but  
 i am not real anxious about that  
 frankly by the time i get the car probably the heat wave will break and it will not be so bad working on it  
 oh yeah  
 well if it does need a head gasket it is  
 i i looked it up in volvo and it looks like volvo is probably one of the easiest cars there is to change a head gasket on  
 yeah  
 yeah but i am going to have to get get one that is better calibrated  
 because i am  
 it it is just something where  
 they they make a kind where you set a dial and it clicks and so on  
 i am going to have to do that because i have got to have real precision if i  
 well  
 i do not know how you know i mean  
 i have never heard of trading tools but  
 well in you know unless it was with a a person but  
 but  
 yeah the other one is fine for things like setting the wheel bearings and that kind of thing  
 but i am i am going to have to have real precision on  
 on -ed  
 but the way i look at it is if i am buying oh four to five thousand dollar car for  
 twenty five hundred and i have to go out and spend forty dollars on a wrench i am not really going to worry about it  
 okay  
  
 what do those cost  
 i see  
  
 uh-huh  
 and were you telling me once that you had an electronic news service  
 through your computer  
 what was the other thing you said  
 eprom  
 what what is that  
 mhm  
 oh  
  
 mhm  
 mhm  
  
 mhm  
 mhm  
  
 mhm  
 kid of weird but  
 though i might get on to the net that way  
 and  
 and i will let you know if if that address becomes available  
 there is also supposedly you know a magazine listing all of the internet service providers here and  
 denver which i need to still look over  
 generally runs about  
 you know i have heard of things as low as twenty dollars a month  
 actually there is this one place  
 that is bulletin board  
 which allows they are  
 i guess trying to attract new people so it is like twenty five dollars  
 for the first year  
 but in general i think the theory is access providers generally charge about twenty dollars a month  
 and the price can go up from there depending on how much  
 volume you expect to be using  
 last year it was like seventy five dollars for a slip account which is like this  
 like you know dedicated line  
 between your computer and theirs  
 now there is i think their price has gone down to about forty dollars a month  
 so  
 i still need to do some more looking these are all just kind of you know  
 hearsay  
 yeah i used to r- have zenec which is santa cruise operations version of unec  
 installed on my two eighty six and  
 it has you know it has been reconfigured it back to a dos machine we use it for  
 you know burning eprom\'s and you know doing kind of the low level  
 development kinds of things on it  
 eprom programming  
 yeah it is  
 erasable programmable read only memory  
 but it is not modifiable unless you use a higher voltage  
 hence the term to burn a chip you you have the you have a programmer which  
 has a special socket that you drop the chip into and you then  
 it then raises the voltage up to about well depending on the chip any anywhere from twelve to twenty five volts  
 normal operating voltage is at five volts  
 so at the higher voltage it  
 i forget the exact physics of it but you end up kind of like an etch a sketch you know you you put some  
 you you you burn zeros into it  
 it starts out being all ones and then you burn the zeros in  
 and then you  
 with a eprom you use ultra violet light to  
 dislodge the electrons and then you know it it erases it back to one  
 and then there is also electrically eraseable which uses another  
 voltage to discharge the  
 the memory location  
 so it is kind of a  
 you know it takes about  
 depending on the chip you know f- and the strength of the eraser anywhere from five to twenty minutes you erase it  
 you know and then you have got a  
 you know download the program to the programmer and then it burns it in so you know the whole thing  
 can take you know a bit of time  
 but it is a you know it is a good way to  
 you know make changes to a system just by swapping out a chip  
 and  
 you know so we have got an eprom programmer we have got a  
 programmer for you know micro controllers which also have eprom in them  
  
 that kind of thing  
 oh another thing we use it for is like uploading and downloading programs from the h p forty eight g  
 to a graphic calculator  
 programmable  
 it is good we you know it is it is cheaper to buy a an h p  
 unbelievable  
 yeah every day every day every day  
 oh my goodness you mean  
 but sh-  
 but you mean even with that that it is not helping her  
 i know i know  
 yeah  
 oh i know oh please i do not even want to hear that that upsets me  
 it really does  
 poor thing i feel bad  
 yeah  
 i do because it is not you know i look at dad and  
 i know  
 i know but they just do not s- you know  
 th- they are just so used to that all day all night that  
 it just becomes their job and that is it and  
 it is too bad because you know you you do hurt  
 yeah  
 oh my goodness  
 everybody is sick  
 everybody is sick  
 i do not know  
 who is at the shop stina dolores just walked in  
 no dolores valens  
 fran caparra is here  
 julia is here isabelle nicks she will be here for another couple of weeks then she is going back to florida  
 everybody you know it was busy busy this morning a lot of new faces  
 everybody  
 yeah they all are they are all switching around  
 delia pat and liz  
 she is doing much better  
 yeah there is a lot of new faces a lot of new faces  
 yeah every time in fact pat spinazola just left and she said oh every time i come in there is a new faces and i said thank god  
 off and on she is okay  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah i think she does her knee was the second time she had it done it was swollen a long long time more than the other one  
 so it might have just been worse but it just took a lot more recuperating and she had trouble with swelling and then she got an infection  
 so it was a lot different from the first time i think if it had happened this way she would not have had the second one done  
 oh gee  
 not at her age  
 not at her age  
 yeah not p- no pain killers help her  
 that is unbelievable  
 yeah  
 i know  
 i told you did i tell you that we saw tricia in the  
 at the hospital when dad went for his therapy she goes there for arm therapy  
 not the hospital the orthopedics plus  
 she goes there for arm therapy  
 well after the mastectomy  
 she does therapy for the muscles  
 and i was so happy to see her because i had not gone to the house you know i just sent flowers but  
 and i kept asking corinne but i never went and  
 oh it was just so good to hug her and  
 she looks she looks good she has got a baseball hat on because she lost all her hair  
 but  
 she looks so good and she said i understand i know how it is i said well i just want to come but  
 i never know when the right time is for you and  
 i just know what it is like when you go through this because i have seen it with my mother and my sister-in-law so i know that you would rather not have people  
 and she says mom always tells me you know that you ask for me she said and that is what is important so  
 i told you michelle passed her b- state boards did not i  
 yeah i think i think you said you sent her one  
 i do not think she did yeah i do not think they picked her you know they told her to come in right after we got in but it was just so good to hug her you know  
 and she she looks good but now she just had a treatment a week ago today and this whole week she is no good  
 no good you know it is that h- that week after that they just feel so terrible you know  
 i know i know so corinne and joe they will be going back to florida shortly too  
 she says we told her we would stay and she said no there is no sense in staying it is just this is the way it is going to be and  
 if my blood is okay they give me the treatment if it is not i wait another week  
 because she should by now have been all over it but three times she went the blood was low so they could not do it  
 so they postponed it another week so then you are like a month behind  
 so  
 what  
 i know  
 a lot  
 well i have to go to the store and get grandma some steroids i just talked to her doctor and he said he would put  
 give her a sh- an a burst of steroids and if that does not help the pain in the shoulders we are going to he is going to go put the  
 cortisone in the joints again  
 because yesterday  
 they just put the ts- cortisone in her muscle yesterday  
 that he wants to put e-  
 no but see they did not put it in the joints yesterday the doctor just the doctor she saw yesterday  
 i do not think he knew what really what he was doing  
 i mean he was not  
 proficient at it like doctor clausen is so he just put it in the muscle and figured it will  
 i- it will get  
 somewhere near the joints but it is not the same as when you put it in the joints  
 i know but  
 she does not feel like eating she does not feel like doing nothing

 he is like hey lady got any iced tea no  
 then everyone yells fuck you and then they count down the score and like suppose the score was se- we had  
 seven points it would be like one two three four five six seven we want more

 x number of the ones that are like in light rotation and then after that you can play whatever you want  
 yeah  
 like i i saw the like the drawer where they keep all the c d\'s that are in rotation but i did not really get a good look at it  
 oh i d- i do not know because i do not think it is some a lot of it or not a lot of it but some of it has to do with just like the music director\'s preferences  
 and i do not know what all else but

 i do not know  
 so do we  
 oh my god

 now do you just get a time and then you play whatever you want or  
 yeah we have that  
 same  
 that is like us yeah  
 do you any of the bands that like are on rotation on your  
 because i am wondering if it is the same as ours  
 uh-huh  
 yeah well same with us but  
 i was just wondering like you know are they the same ti- same bands if it is like all college radio i guess  
  
 i am afraid to drive but they said you should be able to drive  
 because it is supposed to correct to twenty thirty and you can drive up to twenty forty  
 but e- but  
 you know if my vision is any measure of  
 i i think i would be dangerous on the road  
 so i do not know anyway  
 how is school  
 is it  
 ooh  
 ooh  
 are they  
 did you  
 uh-huh  
 di-  
 did you find any part time work  
 oh yeah i think so  
 oh you did  
  
 yeah right  
 that is to do what now  
 now where would that be  
  
  
 well how is your money  
 yeah i got it the other day  
 no note but i realized well you wrote me a letter before so i guess it just came in installments  
 mhm  
  
 that will be it will not it  
 it is  
 yeah well we should celebrate  
 i do not know the trouble is it is so far away that it is hard to  
 well are you keeping pretty busy  
  
 uh-huh  
 well  
 maybe  
 maybe the weekend of my birthday  
 i hope the weather would not be bad by then  
 oh i know it frosted here last night  
 and it is supposed to frost again tonight  
 i had to go out and bring in as many tomatoes as i could but  
 there are still blossoms on the plant so  
 nipping them in the bud  
 too bad  
 oh i  
 protested about karen not  
 giving me a choice of schedule and classes to teach and  
 so today she had me come in and  
 let me go over them and  
 yeah so she gave me a choice  
 mhm  
 well i thought it was amiable  
 the only trouble is i talked to the  
 p a e person who is the head of the union  
 he went ahead and set up an appointment with the academic vice president who i have never had any satisfaction talking to  
 and we are supposed to meet on tuesday morning about  
 the fact that they changed my grade without my permission and  
 on that case this summer and  
 and in the %ah the other issue was a choice of schedule of which  
 took care of itself today so  
 oh i bet  
 really  
 oh  
 oh no that is not good  
 mhm  
 time consuming  
 yeah it is i did homework for four hours today  
 and i have got a couple more hours to w- to do yet  
 my first tests are next week  
 mhm so i got to  
 study  
 big time  
  
 e- i told you i had a paper route right  
 but i quit that  
 yeah geraldo worked y- i mean when you when it boils down to the hours and everything it really will works out to about four or five bucks an hour so  
 so i said nah i do not think i am going to do that but i i have couple interviews on monday for  
 temper- part part time  
 part part time positions  
 i am glad they are getting that on tape  
 that are  
 e- eight bucks an hour monday wednesday friday all day  
 administrative accounting  
 and various other duties  
 well i  
 the the people who are setting the job up are temporary agencies so the companies  
 i am not real sure where yet i mean i know where they are at but they did not give me the name of a company they just gave me the name of a contact person  
 so  
 they are not like big name companies but these positions are temp to hire so like if it works out  
 then i i you know i could be hired by them  
 so anyway  
 okay okay did you get my check  
 okay good  
 mhm i wa- i just just wanted to get it out in the mail that is all  
 just get it to you and i still plan on sending you another three fifty october  
 hopefully october one  
 that will be it for that and then i only owe you that thousand that you loaned me  
 but that will be it for the initial loan  
 we should what should we do  
 i know it is hard to coordinate when can you when can you come out  
 right now  
 if i get one of these jobs that i am interviewing for though i will still have weekends free  
 you know  
 so  
 you now any time you wanted to come out like say  
 maybe a friday saturday sunday  
 whenever is good for you  
 okay that sounds good sounds good to me  
 no it is it is cold already  
 yeah it frosted here too  
 but man i do not know what happened  
 oh man  
 pun intended  
 oh boy but anyway so what else is new  
 mhm  
 oh yeah  
 so it kind of worked out  
 did it cause any friction  
 well that is good i am glad to hear that  
 mhm  
 aw  
 mhm  
 we are starting the transition i you know told the students that they were going to you know what the new plan was and  
 they are not that thrilled about it but  
 that i am leaving that they are going to have to go into another class that is already going  
 and  
 you know with a lot of other people  
 and so they are not happy about that so  
 but anyway  
 you know that is they do not have any choice in it  
 that is the way the program\'s going to be  
 and  
 they had a cake for me yesterday  
 yeah i thought that was nice they all signed the card and the whole thing  
 and so i got i got one more week  
 and that is it so  
 i am really kind of excited about  
 you know about finishing u- finishing up and going down there  
 and i want to  
  
 yeah  
 yeah i d- that would be that would be much easier  
 the the the only problem is that the the rents there are are really really high and  
 yeah i want to be right in the town right in the city where i am working  
 well we- well it is nice i mean it  
 it is a it is a good place but just to cut down on the on the commuting  
 because if i am and i am in the right place i would only be like two or three miles from the job that is  
 what i would like ideally that is what i would like  
 i w- when i when i start there was  
 there was somebody down there that was dealing that that has that is into real estate and i am going to ask but i have been reading the paper and  
 the you know they they want like close to a thousand dollars  
 so everything i noticed is you know you go to the grocery store you go to the gas station  
 you know is a lot higher  
 and at least what i was doing like for the summer is that i was coming up and  
 never buying gas down there but getting it here or if i went to long island i would get it there where it is it is cheaper and  
 and then i would  
 you know load up on my groceries and anything i was going to have i would bring down there so i would kind of avoid it that way  
 but you know i i that would be a whole lot easier but then  
 i do not know whenever i would get to see you and mike  
 i would not i would be a lot closer to you  
 and that th- and that part i would like but  
 like for any you know any occasions anything  
 you know i i do not know  
  
 y- y- i i just get the feeling that  
 that you would probably come up to this area  
 but not where i am as you know as often so i  
 yeah and you  
 so i and then of course when  
 jill comes home like and she will be coming home at thanksgiving  
 and everybody is going to be congregating up here  
 so y- y- you know it is  
 it is a tough decision but then as i was saying on the on the other hand  
 as soon as i  
  
 yeah i yeah i know it so i i have i  
 i i am stuck here at least through through august  
 because of because of the lease but even even at that i am i am not  
 i am stuck here but i am tied in but i am not if i wanted to leave i could do that  
 i could just wait until somebody comes in and  
 and wants the place and so i would not be pressed to go  
 and then the other option that i was thinking of was after the  
 after the car is paid off  
 to go  
 move my stuff into beakman and use that as a primary residence but yet  
 but then like rent a room down there in the town i am i am working in  
 so at least what i will be paying is a room which which should be a lot cheaper and  
 and i would be i i would be just adding to the time  
 mhm  
 what to you mean oh about you are leaving  
 mhm  
  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 i think you should move down there  
 i was thinking about it if you are paying this woman money plus you are paying your rent  
 y- it would be worth it to get an apartment down there you are paying the same  
 did you look though i mean i do not think they are i do not i know they are higher they are probably a little bit  
 higher than what you are paying now but if you are paying that woman money to s- stay there and you are paying  
 you know your rent i am sure you could find an apartment for the same amount of money  
 why  
 oh  
 uh-huh  
  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 right  
 i do not know about that  
 i mean yeah i guess you know we have more friends and stuff there  
 but  
 you know  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 that is kind of a ri- a l- a little bit ridiculous though to stay in  
 you know one place for an o- you know for an occasion for thanksgiving that comes around once a year  
 you know i mean i do not know  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 right  
 right  
 mhm  
 and  
 there is  
 i know  
 oh it was such a shock so  
 ha-  
 no  
 no but that is so important yeah  
 oh yes you are  
 oh  
 oh my goodness  
 sure  
 oh my yeah  
 oh i know  
 really  
 oh my good- now  
 oh my goodness we-  
 a call up oh my goodness janet  
 with your  
 no no you are so conscientious  
 yeah  
 it seems to be it seems to be cycling yeah ye-  
 oh no no  
 oh i sure will  
 yeah he he has not oh i hear her  
 oh she talks so well  
 does she does she look at words and read things i guess children are more into t v than  
 oh  
 oh wawa oh my you go ahead if you have to  
 right right  
 oh i had three at one time all at home you know  
 clinging to my skirts but i mean i enjoyed it looking back on it but it was  
 very frustrating in a way if there was anything else you wanted to do like  
 even if you wanted to go into the library say and get a book it was  
 ver- i had to dress three children get the car you know  
 but now  
 i know  
 it was hard  
 i know  
 well  
 i well  
 i do not know about the money end of it that is not all that good but i know what  
 yeah  
 it is it is a little more  
 secure probably  
 hopefully  
 oh yes  
 i am so oh  
 oh i know i think you you will  
 this will be the happiest time with  
 the children in my opinion you know and you will look back and be very glad that you did do it  
 oh yes  
 i know  
 oh it sh-  
 oh i know how is your husband adjusting to the family and i bet he does  
 true  
 oh my  
 oh that is right  
 oh that is right i  
 right  
 what what is not that terrible i i too am catholic  
 but for god and it was december eighth is something special i forget oh do not tell him  
 do not tell him i forgot oh my goodness  
 oh there is a a real  
 will to live after all he has been through before you know an-  
 like sure  
 aw  
 well sometimes people do not really have a warning for these things and i have on my refrigerator this scripture about teaching us to number our days it is from psalm ninety i do not know if you could remember that but you know ninety i always thought gee if  
 yeah if we could live to be ninety you know that is old but my poor mom is only sixty five i thought wow you know i am going to inherit half of her genetic  
 background so that made me effective the fifteenth i am no longer in the active reserves you know the the rumor in my unit was we were going to get called up on the eighteenth anyway and i thought oh i cannot live with kind of stress you know  
 i do not believe in what they are doing over there i think it is wonderful that the people would like to try to  
 have peace with each other but  
 you know my father-in-law has told me all these  
 stories about world war two and he said even the nazis did not like the serbians they would not get along and i thought oh gracious you know  
 why are w- with our country we have so many problems here with our schools and the way our older people are treated and  
 i do not think our country should spend what do they say now six billion over there on  
 oh  
 maybe it is just two billion i get the billions confused with the number of land mines and how much money we are going to spend  
 but i will still be on a like a call up list if they need a dietician but  
 you know me boy i am not going to  
 you know shirk my responsibility but i am  
 certainly not going to go willingly i  
 saw too many body bags coming back when i was in high school twenty years ago and you know it is a cycle the world is on a cycle so  
 yeah  
 well i do not want to get off the topic but do tell your husband i said you know hi and gosh i am  
 yeah yeah that is okay you can have some more  
 yeah sh-  
 oh she loves  
 yeah loves the cat and the hat n- on the lifetime channel this morning there was a special with penelope leach about toddler play time water okay  
 she said do not let the play time do not sit the children into your idea of  
 play they have more fun with just  
 you know the boxes and so really i have  
 i have been adju- adjusting pretty well to all of this  
 but i tell you i do not know how people did it years and years ago when they had like seven or eight of them and  
 yeah  
 oh sure  
 aw  
 well you know too my mom even has this friend that came to visit her that was part of a family of she said either twenty or twenty one i said mom you got to be kidding she said no  
 but honest to goodness they had that many children that you know those years and i said how would you keep your mind  
 but i remember when i first met you though and you were real positive about the whole thing and i thought she wants to be a dietician she is crazy there is so many other things she could do  
 but i am really glad you are in the administrative side now because that is where the money is at and you learn a lot more you know  
 no no i mean as far as handling  
 handling the budgets and knowing how much each portion is  
 yeah it is a lot more analytical yeah i think  
 dealing with the average person with their  
 to stress over what they were getting on their trays i mean a lot of times you know even after i have a thing on ketogenic diet i mean to send to you too and that but even after these years that is pretty much what we were still doing  
 and that is why i decided to cash in my chips when i had colleen because i thought oh this is not going to change i can come back in ten years it will be the same thing  
 and she will never be so cute again you know  
 well it is truly the sandwich generation though because like each day she learns something new and now my mom is pretty much so limited and it is so hard to see this but  
 i can see the joy she brings her so that makes me feel happy but it  
 it is really hard to see one person that you have  
 love so much you know kind of check out then you know starting to learn how to love this other one that  
 gosh i have such a responsibility now  
 oh  
 oh he loved it he is doing good you know his  
 you know how men are their lives do not change all that much i mean he  
 still doing his volunteer firefighter thing and  
 he is having a lot of carbon monoxide alarms going off now so he is making all kinds of extra runs and he is all happy about that but  
 and of course he has all the relatives here in town so there is  
 all kinds of things going on but  
 i think okay in that he is  
 you know  
 catholic and a lot more scheduled than i am i am more interdenominational and  
 i do not remember all these special days i mean he goes to church all the time now this let us see what was it on  
 friday it was something and i thought oh you got to be kidding me it is starting already you know  
 oh  
 you should meet my mother-in-law she never forgets  
 i keep thinking too he is the eldest son so someday we are going to be responsible for all the grave blankets and i know this is long distance but sometimes you got to ask me to tell me  
 yeah except it actually was hard like we had the go- we got kind of complicated  
 and then  
 and then  
 yeah then the well the square was not complica- but like the things we di- you know we woul-  
 of course he did like some really funky cool stuff and made us all feel like idiots but  
 yeah  
 and then the sticks oh man they were a pain in the ass they kept falling apart and shit they were like these little bowels  
 like little tiny ones and  
 we had to make shit out of them and  
 that was such a pain in the ass i knock okay i like first i start off doing this thing and it became this really ugly looking bird house and this one girl was like totally laughing at me i was like shut up dana  
 and so then i started making something else  
 and i worked like two weeks on it  
 and it just  
 was not turning out the way i wanted it too  
 so then i started doing something different to it and i knocked it off the table and it broke  
 i was like this is not  
 i think  
 so then i figured out something else to do so i actually made things but a couple like things but  
 but then it but dana was all worried because she had strep throat so she missed like two weeks of cla-  
 and this cl- he said  
 because i was all like how the hell do you grade you know the first thing i ask i usually do not ask questions like that but in an art class i am like how do you grade  
 and he was like well  
 he was like if you come every day and you work you get a b  
 so i am like alright well i have a b  
 and so i mean i i  
 i would hope that you know i put in enough effort that maybe he would give me a little higher  
 yeah  
 temporary it has been there for like three years  
 yes but he said and there is li- it is so hot in the building have you ever been in it  
 it is like a sauna  
 it is a sauna  
 it really it is horrible  
 he said you cannot come in at  
  
 you are schwitzen totally  
 do not know whatever  
 but yeah he said you cannot even go in there in the summer time  
 like  
 no one can work in there in the summer time because it is so bad  
 i do not know  
 i guess they have more room because there is not students and they can just use the professors can use the students\' studio space in like meyerson  
 i do not know what the hell they did though but he like  
 over the summer he just works in his studio  
 out in chestnut hill  
 and well actually he does not have any money  
 but  
 they rent him and his wife he is like fifty two years old and he is renting  
 i hope i own a house when i am fifty two years old  
 really  
 mhm i thought it was cheap in seattle  
 oh  
 uh-huh uh-huh  
 wow  
 wow  
 wow  
 no i have not checked today  
 cool  
 cool  
  
 guess what i am going to a wedding on saturday  
 tricia reinhardt  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 yeah kind of  
 yeah we are driving with mike chergalis and heidi heidi is going to go visit ellen  
 so which is nice because we get to split the car cost before we  
 even though it is going to be pretty cheap anyway mike said  
 friday and saturday because mike will not drive up on saturday morning  
 which is fine i mean  
 well i have an exam eight thirty to ten thirty mike is taking the whole day off mike wanted to leave at like nine o\'clock in the morning but  
 that is not happening yeah i know  
 and brian brian he will take a half day and heidi is going to take a half day  
 and so we will leave like between noon and one or something  
 yeah but but like the wedding is not till five thirty so i do not know what the hell we are going to do like all day saturday  
 at her church  
 marysville  
 ohio  
 columbus  
 yeah maybe we will hang out with heidi and ellen  
 yeah i know it is just like i mean we could have left like early saturday  
  
 but  
 so  
 she is getting married  
 i called she is registered at service merchandise  
 so i called up  
 today and the woman is like what is your price range and i said i do not know between thirty and forty dollars  
 and so she was telling me all these things and nothing appealed to me  
 so then she said well they are she has more things that are cheaper  
 or more expensive i was like well tell me some of the cheaper stuff  
 and so she like ordered wine glasses she wanted two sets of wine glasses that are fourteen dollars each  
 yeah you could do we used to do that like in elementary school  
 like make those spheres and make those like pyramids and stuff  
 it  
 oh  
 it was probably a fancier square  
 yeah  
 well let us see he has had a little more practice  
 yeah  
 shut up  
 mhm  
 no no  
 it is not your class  
 that is cool  
 oh no  
 but yes  
 so that is cool  
 at least i get a b  
 where where di- where were your classes way up in those blue temporary  
 well yeah permanent temporary  
 yeah it is kind of cool but it does not look like it has much ventilation  
 it is a sauna  
 you watch schwitzen  
 drag  
 where do they work  
 that is true  
 that is cool  
 mhm very fancy  
 really  
 yeah there is a lot of people out in seattle though that rent  
 like forever just because the housing is so expensive  
 well not houses  
 i am like housing is okay i mean you can find stuff to rent but  
 it  
 i do not know like houses  
 are like these little tiny little salt box houses you know  
 for like  
 a hundred and fifty thousand dollars  
 or more  
 it is insane  
 you know like well it is like no wonder yeah i do not know it is kind of weird  
 so  
 did you get my email today  
 no check it because i i sent you  
 my mom got them in the mail from a friend of hers who got it from her daughter but anyway the point is they are a bunch of lightbulb jokes  
 and they make fun of like everyone in the iv- just basically the schools all up and down the east coast it is very hilarious  
 who\'s wedding  
 no way  
 wow  
 are you very excited  
 are you driving or what  
 cool  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 oh yeah he is going to spend the night then saturday  
 do you have class on friday  
 you are like hello i have an exam  
 that is good enough  
 well  
 where is it being held  
 in  
 what is the next biggest town next to marysville  
 well you can hang out in columbus for the day  
 i mean  
 yeah i mean it is just a day you can entertain yourself  
 columbus in the capital  
 never mind  
 that is very exciting  
 that is practical  
 uh-huh  
 let us just go with the cheaper stuff  
 hello  
 yeah  
 no and i am saying i am using that as an example though  
 you understand there is different fields  
 in in mcdonald\'s right  
 and so when you go out and try to find another job right  
  
 do you understand that it does let us it i mean let us say that it is you know say it is macy\'s then okay  
 you know and then you have  
 you h- one cashiering job one job in the working inventory  
 you know like  
 the the name does not really matter okay we- my point is the experience  
 you know and  
 specialization  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 but would you call it specialized if you only been there one year though  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 oh i see  
 mhm  
 oh  
 uh-huh  
 mhm  
 mhm  
  
  
 yeah  
 well you know you understand then that if you take if you do not take a telemarketing job then you  
 probably will not even come up here  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 but you are going to take it anyway  
 the  
 dispatch  
 uh-huh  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 do you get overtime for that  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 i thought you you said you were  
 oh okay  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 yeah  
  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
 mhm  
  
  
 mhm  
 yeah  
 well i i very much  
 doubt that you can really compare me to a p- a person that works at mcdonald\'s who is flipping burgers  
 okay  
 yes i know that  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 well that is what i mean i mean  
 if if i have specialization in three areas  
 compared to one  
 you know i have  
 but you see three years all three but all three of them  
 i have dealt with customer service  
 and the fact that  
 the fact that i been able to to  
 i been very productive  
 in those two areas so far  
 telemarketing  
 i was very good at  
 i was  
 always above a hundred percent  
 so and so forth clerical i am above my expectation too  
 okay so the fact that i am able to change over from one area to another  
 learn to adapt and do so well  
 i think that is a very good point in my area  
 okay and if i transfer over to dispatch which is which is a very high stressed environment  
 if i am able to do that  
 and convert so easily and and be able to do  
 to do well as far as productivity and getting people to cooperate with me  
 i mean  
 that is far more experienced than  
 anything else that i could have  
 i could imagine as far as telemarketing ever you know  
 i stayed two or three years in telemarketing you know compared to  
 being able to change from one place to another and  
 adapt and everything i think that is more important  
 yeah  
 probably  
 yeah  
 what  
 uh-huh i i requested it in fact  
 i am kind of i i really do not like  
 my clerical job  
 because of the people that i am around  
 too many people i mean really tim i mean the supervisors there  
 okay we have  
 we have one main supervisor and two  
 assistant supervisors  
 well when the main supervisor is is not there and the two assistant supervisors are there  
 doing whatever they they fool around  
 they do not do a good job  
 and i have already i have already  
 went to the head person about this  
 and everything and they got talked to and they were good for a while and then bam  
 it is again you know same thing you see so much favoritism going on  
 but finally because you know what  
 every single day i always work late  
 later than i am supposed to  
 okay like nine o\'clock when i am ready to go whatever  
 i always sta- i always end up spe- spending maybe ten fifteen minutes  
 after  
 nine o\'clock  
 yes i do get overtime  
 but if i stayed six minutes  
 overtime  
 i do not get paid for that six minutes  
 and during the six and and there have been plenty of times where i have sat there and i have had to you know hurry and rush and wo- and blah blah blah  
 things like that just because you know they do not want to pay me overtime or whatever but nine o\'- if nine o\'clock strikes i should be able to get out  
 just like everybody else because i am not getting paid for those extra minutes  
 that i am there  
 only only seven minutes and after  
 yeah and the thing is is i do not goof around or anything  
 you know it is not like i i nine o\'clock strikes and  
 bam you know i- i am sitting there  
 spending five minutes getting ready nothing like that  
 you know i-  
 those minutes are after nine o\'clock i spend working  
 you know and that is what gets me really mad and i have  
 done this for a very long time  
 while everybody else in clerical do not do not do that because everybody just leaves  
 you know and they do not get talked to nothing  
 you know i am always stuck getting there late  
 and then not just that but also the assistants i mean  
 finally on s- just last saturday  
 i mean i was just  
 so mad because they scheduled me by myself  
 until from eight thirty to five thirty  
 everybody left at five o\'clock so i had half an hour by myself  
 we were doing fine the whole entire day but finally  
 when when those two other clerical people left  
 i was by myself for that half hour okay fifteen minutes before five thirty  
 i was hit with a whole bunch of sales  
 the phones are ringing  
 people are coming up to me asking me questions  
 the s- assistant supervisors did nothing  
 i ended up staying there until six o\'clock  
 when after five thirty they started bitching about how late it was and that it was getting close to six o\'clock but they did not help me  
 i mean that is their job  
 you know i mean if you know if they see me falling behind or whatever they do not it is not their job to s-  
 you know be behind me and rag about how late it is and blah blah blah because i am sitting there working  
 i am not i was not taking my o- my sweet time i am very  
 i am very fast you know and it just got me so mad you know that that  
 i do not know where you are working at though  
 how is that  
 you like it

 he asked what mary could teach  
 and then he said can she teach english and we said no and then we went on and on the way home i said to martin  
 i can teach that  
 so the next day i went back  
 and i said do you want a muzungu teacher and oh he was  
 so  
 well it is starting secondary school  
 but it is they do not have a school so they have two classrooms from the nursery school that we are in  
 and they have nothing  
 except kids

 so  
 they ha- we have a i wrote this in my letter we have a chalk board we have chalk and we have a teacher\'s book  
 and it is i- and it is in a in a a nursery school  
 so i- it is set up that way  
 and when we were working on our day books in the other room  
 we were at these little nursery tables  
 and father came in and he saw us well the next day he brought us a table and some chairs  
 so now we have got tables and chairs to sit at

 our lady of i think it is our lady of victory  
 but they all go by me am bira  
 and so we drive as far as the parish church then we park there because you cannot drive in  
 then we walk to school  
 it takes about fifteen minutes to drive to the parish  
 and then it takes me about fifteen minutes to walk to school  
 from the parish down to school

 because all the vol- teachers are almost all volunteers and they have different jobs than that  
 because  
 because well nobody can it is it is nobody can afford anything there  
 well they are just starting and it\'s a very very poor place  
 the most the kids that are coming are kids that cannot afford to go to any school  
 mhm  
 oh

 well thanks a lot  
 thanks for the vote of confidence here  
 holy man  
 no too old to play  
 no pretty soon  
 pretty soon joe and judy and i are going to start taking it up serious you know as soon as we  
 as soon as we have more time  
 you know because we both we both used to like it before we had kids we played a lot and  
 and now we just  
 that was just secondary you know so we never really  
 never really started but maybe by the time you guys come back again we will be  
 we will be in the swing of it so  
 mhm oh come on  
 oh he is not  
 oh  
 mhm  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 mhm  
 yeah just yeah just something to keep to keep hitting  
 that is all it is but  
 yeah right  
 well if i could get there cheap you know have to  
 well mom and dad are going when though  
 they are going this christmas  
 okay  
 oh yeah  
 eight weeks  
 oh  
 oh i never i never w- i knew they would stay a while i mean there is no sense going over there and coming back in a m- you know couple of days  
 yeah yeah  
 there and back  
 yeah  
 yeah  
 well like you say it is a half a week  
 just to get there  
 yeah yeah  
 mhm  
 our my target date was june eighth to finish to finish school  
 but now now these kids here are starting and then you know that th- they are all playing and  
 and that is when a lot of them can you know take off for a day and go to the beach or whatever so i have to  
 be flexible with lee\'s schedule  
 so and next week she is starting  
 well claire\'s kindergarten but she is already past the  
 kindergarten i mean  
 she is in kindergarten because she is five well she just turned six  
 but she is already past all the kindergarten books  
 so i just did not start first with her yet  
 she is she is supposed to be in first grade so  
 i have got so many materials for first grade i am i am not going to start her until august in first grade  
 and then john-john he does kindergarten stuff even though he is just he just turned four but  
 i have just been giving him something  
 you know yeah tha- exactly  
 and then i let him play most of the time so  
 but you know they are doing they are doing well i cannot think of anything else  
 leigh is starting a tennis c- leigh takes tennis lessons did you know that  
 yeah she has been  
 well no no i do not anymore  
 john john-john get off the bed  
 leigh has been taking them for oh i do not know six months or so and now this next week i just our the tennis teacher was just here  
 there is this tennis clinic throughout the whole city at this one court where he teaches  
 the tennis teacher and it is a three week clinic and it is it is like eight from eleven and one to three or one to four  
 and now lee\'s going to do that so now we are going to have to really do her schooling really early in the morning so because it is a good op-  
 right but i mean it is good for her because it is an opportunity for her to meet other girls her age  
 and just to talk and have fun an- an- an- a- with you know once you if you do learn tennis  
 you know and you do intense three weeks like that that usually really helps you and she likes it so  
 oh let me tell you what bill she will be beating you big time when she gets home  
 well  
 yeah well you know she will be twelve or thirteen  
 and that and she might be pretty and how old will you be let us not talk about that  
 no way no way people are living longer these days bill  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 uh-huh  
 well i will have to the last year we are here before we come home i will have to take some lessons  
 it is too bad you guys could not come here and take oh it really helps see john\'s not taking lessons now  
 no because leigh takes them so john does not wha- i- l- john will like play with the instructor ten minutes leigh will take like forty-five minutes of the lesson i think  
 and he will take the last just hitting some balls  
 so but he plays you know a few times a week  
 but when we go back once neil gets older you know the same you know once your kids get a little older and you can  
 leave them a little better but  
 then i can play it is so nice here if you can get someone even a ballboy that you do not have to pay very much  
 just to hit the balls to you  
 you know so you can really like hit a hundred balls or something like that  
 you guys have to come over here and get some cheaper tennis lessons  
 there so expensive over there  
 you cannot but you can get it seven fifty round trip i would say that is pretty cheap  
 i am serious they are going to come  
 mid december  
 th- they are coming december and u- you know they are fighting over how long to stay  
 but i think i might just lose your dad\'s vi- passport or something  
 he says he only wants to stay for what four weeks and then your mom says eight weeks so we they are trying to  
 they are trying to settle on six weeks i think she is just saying eight weeks so that you can they can compromise in the middle with six weeks  
 i hope  
 no because just the travel the just the travel time is one week for sure  
 you know and then  
 yeah and then plus getting to our island it is not like they just fly right into our island  
 they have to fly to either manila or then there is an overnight there and then there is another half a day travel here  
 so i- i- that is what i mean it is kind of  
 yeah  
 y- it is a y- for sure just to get here  
 and then just to but they did so well last time with with jet lag they did not really have any problem  
 you know they just you just u-
